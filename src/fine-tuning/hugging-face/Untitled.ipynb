      "# Reentrancy\n",
      "Also known as or related to race to empty, recursive call vulnerability, call to the unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Reentrancy attack, probably the most famous Ethereum vulnerability,surprised everyone when discovered for the first time. It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Attack Scenario\n",
      "1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n",
      "2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n",
      "3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n",
      "4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n",
      "5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Examples\n",
      "The following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n",
      "```\n",
      "function withdraw(uint _amount) {\n",
      "\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n",
      "\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n",
      "\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n",
      "}\n",
      "````\n",
      "\n",
      "Reentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\n",
      "We refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n",
      "1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n",
      "2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \n",
      "can be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n",
      "3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n",
      "4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\n",
      "We consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation âˆ§ balanceDeduction âˆ§ zeroParameter âˆ§ (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "#### callValueInvocation\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "#### zeroParameter\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n",
