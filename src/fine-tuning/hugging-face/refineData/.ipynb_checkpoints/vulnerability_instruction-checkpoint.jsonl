{"instruction": "Provide information on the following vulnerability.", "input": "Reentrancy\\nAlso known as or related to race to empty, recursive call vulnerability, call to the unknown.\\n\\nThe Reentrancy attack, probably the most famous Ethereum vulnerability,surprised everyone when discovered for the first time. It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\\n\\n\\n## Attack Scenario\\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract\\'s withdraw() function.\\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn\\'t been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\\n\\n## Examples\\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what\\'s left of the transaction gas:\\n```\\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\\n\\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\\n\\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\\n\\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\\n}\\n````\\n\\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\\n\\n\\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \\n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \\ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00c2\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00c2\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00c2\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### callValueInvocation\\n\\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions.

It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation.

As such, we first utilize the pattern **arithmeticOperation** to filter those functions without the arithmetic operations.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### safeLibraryInvoc\\n\\nCase 1: When there are arithmetic operations between the variables and the arithmetic operations are constrained by the security library function, we label the corresponding function to have no integer overflow/underflow vulnerability.\\n    \\n    ```\\n        1.library SafeMath {\\n        2.    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        3.      assert(b <= a);\\n        4.      return a - b;\\n        5.    }\\n        6.    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256 c) {\\n        7.      c = a + b;\\n        8.      assert(c >= a);\\n        9.      return c;\\n        10.    }\\n        11.}\\n        12.contract StandardToken {\\n        13.    using SafeMath for uint256;\\n        14.    mapping(address => uint256) balances; \\n        15.    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {\\n        16.        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(value);\\n        17.        balances[to] = balances[to].add(value);\\n        18.        return true;\\n        19.    }\\n        20.}\\n    ```\\n    \\nAs can be seen, the subtraction operation between the _balances[msg.sender]_ and the _value_ (line 16) is constrained by the security library function (line 2). Thus, we label the corresponding function _transfer_ to have no integer overflow/underflow vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\\n\\n\\n#### conditionDeclaration\\n\\ncase 1: When the arithmetic operations and corresponding variables appear in the strict conditional statements (e.g., assert, require), we label the corresponding function to have no integer overflow/underflow vulnerability.\\n   \\n    ```\\n        1.contract Overflow_fixed_assert {\\n        2.    uint8 sellerBalance = 0;\\n        3.    function add(uint8 value) returns (uint) {\\n        4.        sellerBalance += value;\\n        5.        assert(sellerBalance >= value);\\n        6.        return sellerBalance;\\n        7.    }\\n        8.}\\n    ```\\n    \\nIt can be observed, there is an addition operation between the _sellerBalance_ and the _value_ (line 4), and _assert_ statement contains the comparison between the r_sellerBalance_ and the _value_ (line 5). Thus, we label the corresponding function _add_ to have no integer overflow/underflow vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\\n\\n\\nCase 2: When the subtraction operation appears in the strict conditional statement (e.g., assert, require) for comparison and the conditional statement appears before the subtraction operation, we label the corresponding function to have no integer overflow/underflow vulnerability.\\n\\n    ```\\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\\n        3.    function transfer(address to, uint value, bytes data) public returns (bool) {\\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= value);\\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - value;\\n        6.        balanceOf[to] = balanceOf[_to] + value;\\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(value)());\\n        8.        return true;\\n        9.    }\\n        10.}\\n    ```\\n \\nAs can be seen, there is a subtraction operation between the _balanceOf[msg.sender]_ and the _value_ (line 5), and the _require_ statement contains the comparison between the _balanceOf[msg.sender]_ and the _value_ (line 4). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no integer overflow/underflow vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\\n\\n\\nCase 3: When the function does not satisfy case 1 and case 2, we label the corresponding function to have integer overflow/underflow vulnerability.\\n    \\n    ```\\n        1. contract Overflow_add {\\n        2.    uint8 sellerBalance = 0;\\n        3.    function add(uint8 value) returns (uint) {\\n        4.        sellerBalance += value;\\n        5.        return sellerBalance;\\n        6.    }\\n        7. }\\n    ```\\n    \\nIt can be observed, there is an addition operation between the _sellerBalance_ and the _value_ (line 4), and no conditional statement used to constrain the two variables after the addition operation. Thus, we label the corresponding function _add_ to have the integer overflow/underflow vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\\n\\n\\nHow to fix integeroverflow/underflow vulnerability code:\\n\\n# *1- Use SafeMath (or Solidity 0.8+ Built-in Overflow Protection)*\\nSolidity prior to version 0.8 does not have built-in overflow/underflow protection.
