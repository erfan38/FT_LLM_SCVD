This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction\\'s miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\\n\\n## Attack Scenario\\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\\n\\n## Examples\\nThe following function only accepts calls that come after a specific date. Since miners can influence their block\\'s timestamp (to a certain extent), they can attempt to mine a block containing their transaction with a block timestamp set in the future. If it is close enough, it will be accepted on the network and the transaction will give the miner ether before any other player could have attempted to win the game:\\n```\\nfunction play() public {\\n\\trequire(now > 1521763200 && neverPlayed == true);\\n\\tneverPlayed = false;\\n\\tmsg.sender.transfer(1500 ether);\\n}\\n```\\n# Instruction\\n\\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\\n\\n\\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \\n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \\n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \\n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc ∧ (TimestampAssign ∨ TimestampContaminate)**.\\n\\n\\n#### TDInvocation\\n\\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \\n\\n\\n#### TDAssign \\n\\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\\n    \\n    ```    \\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \\n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\\n        5.        return closingTime;\\n        6.    }\\n        7.}\\n    ```\\n \\nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\\n\\n\\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\\n\\n    ```    \\n        1.contract Safe {\\n        2.    address public owner;\\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \\n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\\n        9.        return true;\\n        10.    }\\n        11.}\\n    ```\\n    \\nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\\n\\n\\n#### TDContaminate\\n\\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\\n\\n    ```\\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\\n        4.    bool public finalized;\\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\\n        10.   }\\n        11.}\\n     ``` \\n       \\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\\n\\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\\n    \\n    ```\\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\\n        3.         uint release;\\n        4.         uint balance;\\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\\n        6.                tokens += balance;\\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\\n        8.         }\\n        9.         return tokens;\\n        10.   }\\n        11.}\\n    ```\\n    \\n\\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\\n\\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\\n    \\n    ```\\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\\n        2.    address public recipient;\\n        3.    uint public birthday;\\n        4.    function Take () {\\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\\n        8.        return;\\n        9.    }\\n        10.}\\n    ```\\n    \\n\\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.'}\n"

The contract uses block.timestamp in multiple critical operations, making it susceptible to timestamp dependence vulnerabilities. Specifically, lines such as \\'assert(block.timestamp >= STARTDATE);\\', \\'_calculateTokenAmount\\' method, and \\'_updateStateIfExpired\\' method rely heavily on block.timestamp. This exposes the contract to miner manipulation, as miners can adjust the timestamp of the blocks they mine, potentially leading to unfair advantages or contract state manipulations. The precision of time measurements in these instances directly impacts the contract\\'s logic, affecting the sale\\'s status, token distribution, and eligibility for refunds. This dependence on block.timestamp for critical operations without proper safeguards increases the risk of vulnerabilities related to time constraints and miner exploitation.\\n\\nHere is the

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction\\'s miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\\n\\n## Attack Scenario\\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\\n\\n## Examples\\nThe following function only accepts calls that come after a specific date. Since miners can influence their block\\'s timestamp (to a certain extent), they can attempt to mine a block containing their transaction with a block timestamp set in the future. If it is close enough, it will be accepted on the network and the transaction will give the miner ether before any other player could have attempted to win the game:\\n```\\nfunction play() public {\\n\\trequire(now > 1521763200 && neverPlayed == true);\\n\\tneverPlayed = false;\\n\\tmsg.sender.transfer(1500 ether);\\n}\\n```\\n# Instruction\\n\\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\\n\\n\\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \\n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \\n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \\n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc ∧ (TimestampAssign ∨ TimestampContaminate)**.\\n\\n\\n#### TDInvocation\\n\\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \\n\\n\\n#### TDAssign \\n\\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\\n    \\n    ```    \\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \\n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\\n        5.        return closingTime;\\n        6.    }\\n        7.}\\n    ```\\n \\nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\\n\\n\\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\\n\\n    ```    \\n        1.contract Safe {\\n        2.    address public owner;\\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \\n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\\n        9.        return true;\\n        10.    }\\n        11.}\\n    ```\\n    \\nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\\n\\n\\n#### TDContaminate\\n\\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\\n\\n    ```\\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\\n        4.    bool public finalized;\\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\\n        10.   }\\n        11.}\\n     ``` \\n       \\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\\n\\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\\n    \\n    ```\\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\\n        3.         uint release;\\n        4.         uint balance;\\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\\n        6.                tokens += balance;\\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\\n        8.         }\\n        9.         return tokens;\\n        10.   }\\n        11.}\\n    ```\\n    \\n\\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\\n\\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\\n    \\n    ```\\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\\n        2.    address public recipient;\\n        3.    uint public birthday;\\n        4.    function Take () {\\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\\n        8.        return;\\n        9.    }\\n        10.}\\n    ```\\n    \\n\\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.'},\n",

The smart contract contains timestamp dependence vulnerabilities. The use of `block.timestamp` in critical operations makes the contract susceptible to manipulation by miners. Specifically, the `allocateToken` function requires that `block.timestamp > lockStartTime`, and the `vestStage` function calculates the vesting stage based on `block.timestamp.sub(lockStartTime)`. These dependencies on `block.timestamp` can be exploited by miners who can manipulate the timestamp within a certain range. This could lead to premature or delayed token allocations and releases, affecting the intended vesting schedule. The precision of time measurements is also a concern, as the contract relies on exact time calculations for vesting stages, which could be manipulated to the miner\\'s advantage.\\n\\nHere is the vulnerable lines:\\n[{\\'start_line\\': 124, \\'end_line\\': 124, \\'code\\': [\\'require(block.timestamp > lockStartTime);\\']}, {\\'start_line\\': 153, \\'end_line\\': 153, \\'code\\': [\\'uint256 stage = (block.timestamp.sub(lockStartTime)).div(vestingMonths);\\']}]\\n-----------------\\nSmart Contract Code:\\n1: pragma solidity ^0.4.21;\\n2: \\n3:  \\n4: contract Ownable {\\n5:   address public owner;\\n6: \\n7: \\n8:   event OwnershipRenounced(address indexed previousOwner);\\n9:   event OwnershipTransferred(\\n10:     address indexed previousOwner,\\n11:     address indexed newOwner\\n12:   );\\n13: \\n14: \\n15:    \\n16:   function Ownable() public {\\n17:     owner = msg.sender;\\n18:   }\\n19: \\n20:    \\n21:   modifier onlyOwner() {\\n22:     require(msg.sender == owner);\\n23:     _;\\n24:   }\\n25: \\n26: }\\n27: \\n28:  \\n29: library SafeMath {\\n30: \\n31:    \\n32:   function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256 c) {\\n33:     if (a == 0) {\\n34:       return 0;\\n35:     }\\n36:     c = a * b;\\n37:     assert(c / a == b);\\n38:     return c;\\n39:   }\\n40: \\n41:    \\n42:   function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n43:      \\n44:      \\n45:      \\n46:     return a / b;\\n47:   }\\n48: \\n49:    \\n50:   function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n51:     assert(b <= a);\\n52:     return a - b;\\n53:   }\\n54: \\n55:    \\n56:   function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256 c) {\\n57:     c = a + b;\\n58:     assert(c >= a);\\n59:     return c;\\n60:   }\\n61: }\\n62: \\n63:  \\n64: contract ERC20Basic {\\n65:   function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256);\\n66:   function balanceOf(address who) public view returns (uint256);\\n67:   function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool);\\n68:   event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);\\n69: }\\n70: \\n71: \\n72: contract TestVesting is Ownable {\\n73:   using SafeMath for uint256;\\n74: \\n75:   address public teamWallet;\\n76:  \\n77:   \\n78:   uint256 public teamTimeLock = 60 minutes;\\n79:  \\n80:   \\n81:    \\n82:   uint256 public teamAllocation = 3 * (10 ** 1) * (10 ** 5);\\n83:   \\n84:   uint256 public totalAllocation = 3 * (10 ** 1) * (10 ** 5);\\n85:   \\n86:   uint256 public teamStageSetting = 6;\\n87:   \\n88:   ERC20Basic public token;\\n89:    \\n90:   uint256 public start;\\n91:    \\n92:   uint256 public lockStartTime;
