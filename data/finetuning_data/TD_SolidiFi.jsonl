This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "you are a cyber security expert that can detect vulnerable line numbers from the contract as well as vulnerableCode, vulnerabilityReason, potentialSecurityRisk, and fixedCode based on the instruction. instruction:\n\n# Time Manipulation\nAlso known as timestamp dependence.\n\nFrom locking a token sale to unlocking funds at a specific time for a game, contracts sometimes need to rely on the current time. This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;  // Assign block.timestamp to a local variable\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (currentTime * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n# **4- fixing with blockhash**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**:\n    function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n function updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 blockTimeEstimate = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1)) % 10000000000;

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "you are a cyber security expert that can detect vulnerable line numbers from the contract as well as vulnerableCode, vulnerabilityReason, potentialSecurityRisk, and fixedCode based on the instruction. instruction:\n\n# Time Manipulation\nAlso known as timestamp dependence.\n\nFrom locking a token sale to unlocking funds at a specific time for a game, contracts sometimes need to rely on the current time. This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "you are a cyber security expert that can detect vulnerable line numbers from the contract as well as vulnerableCode, vulnerabilityReason, potentialSecurityRisk, and fixedCode based on the instruction. instruction:\n\n# Time Manipulation\nAlso known as timestamp dependence.\n\nFrom locking a token sale to unlocking funds at a specific time for a game, contracts sometimes need to rely on the current time. This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;  // Assign block.timestamp to a local variable\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (currentTime * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n# **4- fixing with blockhash**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**:\n    function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n function updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 blockTimeEstimate = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1)) % 10000000000;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity.

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;  // Assign block.timestamp to a local variable\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (currentTime * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n# **4- fixing with blockhash**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**:\n    function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n function updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 blockTimeEstimate = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1)) % 10000000000;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "you are a cyber security expert that can detect vulnerable line numbers from the contract as well as vulnerableCode, vulnerabilityReason, potentialSecurityRisk, and fixedCode based on the instruction. instruction:\n\n# Time Manipulation\nAlso known as timestamp dependence.\n\nFrom locking a token sale to unlocking funds at a specific time for a game, contracts sometimes need to rely on the current time. This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "you are a cyber security expert that can detect vulnerable line numbers from the contract as well as vulnerableCode, vulnerabilityReason, potentialSecurityRisk, and fixedCode based on the instruction. instruction:\n\n# Time Manipulation\nAlso known as timestamp dependence.\n\nFrom locking a token sale to unlocking funds at a specific time for a game, contracts sometimes need to rely on the current time. This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation.

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1-

 return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1-

**fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "you are a cyber security expert that can detect vulnerable line numbers from the contract as well as vulnerableCode, vulnerabilityReason, potentialSecurityRisk, and fixedCode based on the instruction. instruction:\n\n# Time Manipulation\nAlso known as timestamp dependence.\n\nFrom locking a token sale to unlocking funds at a specific time for a game, contracts sometimes need to rely on the current time. This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;  // Assign block.timestamp to a local variable\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (currentTime * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n# **4- fixing with blockhash**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**:\n    function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n function updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 blockTimeEstimate = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1)) % 10000000000;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1-

**fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;  // Assign block.timestamp to a local variable\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (currentTime * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n# **4- fixing with blockhash**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**:\n    function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n function updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 blockTimeEstimate = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1)) % 10000000000; // Get pseudo-random time\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (blockTimeEstimate * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }"},

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation.

Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "you are a cyber security expert that can detect vulnerable line numbers from the contract as well as vulnerableCode, vulnerabilityReason, potentialSecurityRisk, and fixedCode based on the instruction. instruction:\n\n# Time Manipulation\nAlso known as timestamp dependence.\n\nFrom locking a token sale to unlocking funds at a specific time for a game, contracts sometimes need to rely on the current time. This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;  // Assign block.timestamp to a local variable\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (currentTime * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n# **4- fixing with blockhash**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**:\n    function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n function updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 blockTimeEstimate = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1)) % 10000000000;

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "you are a cyber security expert that can detect vulnerable line numbers from the contract as well as vulnerableCode, vulnerabilityReason, potentialSecurityRisk, and fixedCode based on the instruction. instruction:\n\n# Time Manipulation\nAlso known as timestamp dependence.\n\nFrom locking a token sale to unlocking funds at a specific time for a game, contracts sometimes need to rely on the current time. This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation.

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "you are a cyber security expert that can detect vulnerable line numbers from the contract as well as vulnerableCode, vulnerabilityReason, potentialSecurityRisk, and fixedCode based on the instruction. instruction:\n\n# Time Manipulation\nAlso known as timestamp dependence.\n\nFrom locking a token sale to unlocking funds at a specific time for a game, contracts sometimes need to rely on the current time. This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "you are a cyber security expert that can detect vulnerable line numbers from the contract as well as vulnerableCode, vulnerabilityReason, potentialSecurityRisk, and fixedCode based on the instruction. instruction:\n\n# Time Manipulation\nAlso known as timestamp dependence.\n\nFrom locking a token sale to unlocking funds at a specific time for a game, contracts sometimes need to rely on the current time. This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "you are a cyber security expert that can detect vulnerable line numbers from the contract as well as vulnerableCode, vulnerabilityReason, potentialSecurityRisk, and fixedCode based on the instruction. instruction:\n\n# Time Manipulation\nAlso known as timestamp dependence.\n\nFrom locking a token sale to unlocking funds at a specific time for a game, contracts sometimes need to rely on the current time. This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "you are a cyber security expert that can detect vulnerable line numbers from the contract as well as vulnerableCode, vulnerabilityReason, potentialSecurityRisk, and fixedCode based on the instruction. instruction:\n\n# Time Manipulation\nAlso known as timestamp dependence.\n\nFrom locking a token sale to unlocking funds at a specific time for a game, contracts sometimes need to rely on the current time. This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "you are a cyber security expert that can detect vulnerable line numbers from the contract as well as vulnerableCode, vulnerabilityReason, potentialSecurityRisk, and fixedCode based on the instruction. instruction:\n\n# Time Manipulation\nAlso known as timestamp dependence.\n\nFrom locking a token sale to unlocking funds at a specific time for a game, contracts sometimes need to rely on the current time. This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;

This is usually done via block.timestamp or its alias now in Solidity. But where does that value come from? From the miners! Because a transaction's miner has leeway in reporting the time at which the mining occurred, good smart contracts will avoid relying strongly on the time advertised. Note that block.timestamp is also sometimes (mis)used in the generation of random numbers as is discussed in #6. Bad Randomness.\n\n## Attack Scenario\nA game pays out the very first player at midnight today.\nA malicious miner includes his or her attempt to win the game and sets the timestamp to midnight.\nA bit before midnight the miner ends up mining the block. The real current time is \"close enough\" to midnight (the currently set timestamp for the block), other nodes on the network decide to accept the block.\n\n# Instruction\n\n## 1 Timestamp Dependence\nThe timestamp dependence vulnerability exists when a smart contract uses the *block.timestamp* as part of the conditions to perform critical operations.\n\n\n### How to label the timestamp dependency vulnerability?\nWe refer to several _patterns_ to label the timestamp dependence vulnerability. \n1) **TDInvocation** models whether there exists an invocation to *block.timestamp* in the function. \n2) **TDAssign** checks whether the value of *block.timestamp* is assigned to other variables or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, namely whether *block.timestamp* is actually used. \n3) **TDContaminate** checks if *block.timestamp* may contaminate the triggering condition of a critical operation (e.g., money transfer) or the return value.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a timestamp dependence vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **TimestampInvoc \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (TimestampAssign \u00e2\u02c6\u00a8 TimestampContaminate)**.\n\n\n#### TDInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with the *block.timestamp* statement as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **timestampInvoc** to filter those functions without the statement of *block.timestamp*. \n\n\n#### TDAssign \n\nCase 1: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned to a variable and the variable is used by the following operations or passed to a condition statement as a parameter, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```    \n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.    uint256 public closingTime;       \n        3.    function closeRound() public returns(uint256) {\n        4.        closingTime = block.timestamp + 1;\n        5.        return closingTime;\n        6.    }\n        7.}\n    ```\n \nAs can be seen, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to variable *closingTime* (line 4), and the variable *closingTime* is called in the return statement (line 5). Thus, we label the function *closeRound* to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\nCase 2: When the *block.timestamp* is assigned in the strict condition statements (e.g., _require_ and _assert_), we label the corresponding function to have no  timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```    \n        1.contract Safe {\n        2.    address public owner;\n        3.    uint256 public lock;        \n        4.    function withdrawal( address to, uint value) returns (bool) {\n        5.        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        6.        uint256 time = block.timestamp;\n        7.        require(time >= lock);\n        8.        require(to != address(0));\n        9.        return true;\n        10.    }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the *block.timestamp* is assigned to the variable *time* (line 6), and the variable *time* is assigned in the *require* statement (line 7). Thus, we label the function *withdrawal* to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### TDContaminate\n\ncase 1: When the body of the conditional statement (e.g. _if_ and _while_) involves the return value of the function, we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n\n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleExt {\n        2.    uint public startsAt;\n        3.    uint public endsAt;\n        4.    bool public finalized;\n        5.    enum State {PreFunding, Failure, Finalized}\n        6.    function getState() public constant returns (State) {\n        7.         if(finalized) return State.Finalized;\n        8.         else if (block.timestamp < startsAt) return State.PreFunding;\n        9.         else return State.Failure;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n     ``` \n       \nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _else if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < startsAt_ (line8), the return value of the function _getState_ is _State.PreFunding_. Thus, we label the function _getState_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 2: When the body of the conditional statement involves money operations (e.g.,_transfers_), we label the corresponding function to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract FreezableToken {\n        2.    function releaseAll() public returns (uint tokens) {\n        3.         uint release;\n        4.         uint balance;\n        5.         while (release != 0 && block.timestamp > release) {\n        6.                tokens += balance;\n        7.                msg.sender.call.value(tokens);\n        8.         }\n        9.         return tokens;\n        10.   }\n        11.}\n    ```\n    \n\nIt can be observed, when the conditional statement _while_ satisfies _release != 0 && block.timestamp > release_ (line 5), the function executes the _call.value_ transfer operation (line 7). Thus, we label the function _releaseAll_ to have the timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\nCase 3: When the body of the conditional statement is not related to the return value of the function or money operations (e.g., transfer), we label the corresponding function to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract BirthdayGift {\n        2.    address public recipient;\n        3.    uint public birthday;\n        4.    function Take () {\n        5         if (msg.sender != recipient) throw;\n        6.        if (block.timestamp < birthday) throw;\n        7.        if (!recipient.send (this.balance)) throw;\n        8.        return;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \n\nAs can be seen, when the conditional statement _if_ satisfies _block.timestamp < birthday_ (line 6), the function _Take_ throws an exception. Thus, we label the function _Take_ to have no timestamp dependency vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n#### How to fix the vulnerable code?\nUsing block.timestamp with a TIME_TOLERANCE is a straightforward way to mitigate minor manipulations by adding a small buffer to your time checks. It keeps the logic time-based, which is intuitive if your deadlines are meant to represent actual time. On the other hand, switching to block.number (and using an endDiscountBlock instead of endDiscountTime) reduces the risk of manipulation further because block numbers are less directly controllable by miners. However, this approach requires you to accurately map time to block numbers, which can add complexity. If your system can reliably convert expected times to block numbers, the block.number approach is more robust against timestamp manipulation. Otherwise, a properly calibrated TIME_TOLERANCE with block.timestamp offers a simpler fix.\n\nExamples of fixed code: this is an example of how to fix vulnerable lines to have a safe code:\n \n# **1- fixing with buffer TIME_TOLERANCE:**\n \n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif ((block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n### **fixed Code:** \n if ((block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && state == State.Running) || (block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE >= ENDDATE && weiRaised < MINSALESCAP))\n\n# **2- fixing with block.number**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nif (block.timestamp < cliff) {\n               return 0;\n            } else if (block.timestamp >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\n            } else {\n                return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(start)).div(duration);}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\n if (block.number < cliffBlock) {\n                return 0;\n            } else if (block.number  >= start.add(duration) || revoked[token]) {\n                return totalBalance;\"\n            } else {\n                uint256 blocksElapsed = block.number.sub(startBlock);\n                return totalBalance.mul(blocksElapsed).div(durationBlocks)}\n\n# **3- fixing with assigning block.timestamp to a local variable**\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\n  function updateEventData() public {\n        _eventData_.compressedData = _eventData_.compressedData + (block.timestamp * 1e18) + (team * 1e30);\n    }\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction updateEventData() public {\n        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;
