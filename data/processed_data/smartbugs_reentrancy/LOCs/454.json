            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract uses `send()` to transfer Ether, which allows the receiving contract to execute code before the current function execution completes. This poses a reentrancy risk as a malicious contract could re-invoke the `withdrawEther()` function during the external call, leading to state manipulations before the amount sent is registered.",
