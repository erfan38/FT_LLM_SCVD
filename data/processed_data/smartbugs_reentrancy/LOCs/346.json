            "vulnerabilityReason": "The external call to the `tokenFallback` function of the `receiver` contract happens before the state changes are made. This allows a malicious contract to exploit the situation by re-entering the `transferToContract` function before the state has been updated, leading to a potential reentrancy attack.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can control the receiving contract and will be able to re-enter `transferToContract` before the `subFromAddressBalancesInfo` call completes, allowing them to withdraw tokens multiple times before the contract's balance is properly updated, potentially draining contract resources.",
