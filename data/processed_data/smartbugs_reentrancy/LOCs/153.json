            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of `call.value()` to send Ether allows the caller to execute code on an external contract before the current function completes. This could lead to reentrancy attacks if the external contract is malicious and manages to call back into the function before state changes are completed.",

            "vulnerabilityReason": "The transfer occurs after checking the `_eth` amount but before fully executing the function, creating an opportunity for reentrancy since `_eth` is not deducted until after the external call completes.",
