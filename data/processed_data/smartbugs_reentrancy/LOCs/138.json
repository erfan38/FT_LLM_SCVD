            "vulnerabilityReason": "The vulnerability arises from the order of operations. The contract first sends Ether to the msg.sender using transfer() before updating the clockList[id].reward to 0. This allows an attacker to recursively call trigerAlarmClock during the transfer, withdrawing funds multiple times before the state is properly updated.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly invoking the trigerAlarmClock function through a malicious contract, draining the contract's funds as the state that tracks rewards has not been updated before subsequent transfers are initiated.",
