The check for success does not ensure that state updates occur before the call returns.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can create a malicious contract that uses the fallback function to call back into the `bid` function, allowing them to withdraw funds multiple times before the `bids` mapping and `totalReceived` are updated, draining the contract of Ether.",
