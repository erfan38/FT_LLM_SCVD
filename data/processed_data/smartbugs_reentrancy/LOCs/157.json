            "vulnerabilityReason": "The line uses low-level call to send Ether without checking the success of the transaction, and it occurs after state changes. This can allow reentrancy attacks, where an attacker could call back into the `payout()` function before the `participants[payoutOrder].payout` is properly updated, leading to multiple withdrawals from the same participant.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If an attacker controls the address in `payoutOrder`, they could recursively invoke `payout()`, draining funds rapidly before the contract's state is correctly updated. This could lead to loss of Ether stored in the contract entirely and potentially cause financial losses to other participants.",
