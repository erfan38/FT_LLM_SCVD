The recipient could re-enter the contract during the execution of this function, potentially allowing them to withdraw more than intended.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "A malicious recipient contract could recursively call the withdrawalOwner function before the eth balance is updated, leading to multiple withdrawals from one deposit, effectively draining the contract's funds.",
