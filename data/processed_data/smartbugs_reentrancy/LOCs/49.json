            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function executes an external call to the address `_to` before updating the state of the contract or confirming that the transaction has been approved by the required number of owners. This opens the function to a reentrancy attack, where an attacker could call the `execute` function recursively before the state is updated, allowing them to withdraw funds multiple times.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by deploying a malicious contract that re-enters the `execute` function during the call. This could potentially drain the contract of all its funds, as they can keep executing the function before state updates take place, leading to multiple withdrawals of funds that should not have been available.",
