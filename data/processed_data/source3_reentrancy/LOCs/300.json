            "vulnerabilityReason": "The line makes an external call to `tx.destination.call.value(tx.value)(tx.data)` before the `executed` status of the transaction is marked as true. This allows the possibility of a reentrant call to `executeTransaction` before the contract has properly updated its internal state, which can lead to unauthorized fund withdrawals.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious contract that, upon receiving the funds, calls `executeTransaction` again before the transaction's `executed` flag is set, potentially allowing the attacker to drain the wallet's funds multiple times before the state is updated.",
