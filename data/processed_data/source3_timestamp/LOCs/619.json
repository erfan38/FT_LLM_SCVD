            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of block.timestamp in the releaseTokens function introduces a dependency on the miner-manipulable timestamp. Miners have the ability to set the timestamp within a certain window, which could potentially allow for premature token releases if they manipulate the time to appear just before the releaseDate.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "A miner could manipulate the block timestamp to bypass the intended lock period and trigger the release of tokens before the legitimate release date. This could lead to the owner receiving tokens earlier than designed, undermining the economic security and intended usage of the contractâ€™s token allocation.",
            "fixedCode": "require(releaseDate > block.timestamp + TIME_TOLERANCE); // Use a buffer time to mitigate miner manipulation."
