            "vulnerabilityReason": "The deposit function assigns the current block timestamp to depositTime, which means the record of when the deposit was made relies directly on block.timestamp. Miners can manipulate this value to a small extent, potentially leading to inaccurate deposit timings.",

            "vulnerabilityReason": "The calculateInterest function also relies on the current block timestamp to compute the duration since the last deposit was made, making it susceptible to the same manipulation issues posed by the deposit function.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "As with the deposit function, if the block timestamp is manipulated, it could lead to excessive or diminished interest being calculated, which undermines the integrity of the interest calculation process and affects user payouts.",
