            "vulnerabilityReason": "The release() function uses block.timestamp to compare against releaseTime. This creates a dependency on the timestamp that miners can manipulate, as block timestamps can be adjusted slightly by miners when they create a new block.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Miners could manipulate the block timestamp to release tokens earlier than intended. For example, if the releaseTime is very close to the current time, miners could set the timestamp to the release time or even a slight variance before it, allowing them to trigger the release function without waiting the intended period.",
