            "vulnerabilityReason": "The buyToken function relies on block.timestamp to check if the crowdsale is still active. This reliance makes the function vulnerable because miners can manipulate the block timestamp, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the crowdsale's token purchase functionality.",

            "vulnerabilityReason": "In the finalize function, the use of block.timestamp to verify if the crowdsale has ended opens the door for miner manipulation, allowing them to affect the finalization process of the crowdsale by altering timestamps.",
