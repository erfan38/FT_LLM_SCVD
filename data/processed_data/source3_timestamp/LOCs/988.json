            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of block.timestamp in the buyTokens function to verify the sale period makes the contract susceptible to manipulation by miners. They can artificially adjust the block timestamp, allowing them to bypass the required time checks, effectively influencing the sale period to their advantage.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Miners could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the block timestamp to start the sale early or extend it, potentially allowing them to buy tokens at a lower price or shift benefits unfairly, leading to economic disadvantage for other participants in the sale.",
            "fixedCode": "require(block.timestamp >= startTime + TIME_TOLERANCE && block.timestamp <= endTime - TIME_TOLERANCE, \"Not within sale period\"); // Use a buffer like TIME_TOLERANCE to mitigate timestamp manipulation risk."
