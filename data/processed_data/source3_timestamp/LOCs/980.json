            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract uses block.timestamp to set and check the locking and unlocking of funds. This introduces a vulnerability because miners can manipulate the block timestamp, potentially allowing them to unlock funds before the intended lock period has expired.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If miners manipulate the block timestamp, they could allow early unlocking by executing the unlock function before the actual lock duration has passed, leading to funds being withdrawn prematurely.",
            "fixedCode": "lockTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp + 1 weeks; // Lock time should be set accurately\n// In the unlock function, consider using a more secure approach such as block.number for checks"
