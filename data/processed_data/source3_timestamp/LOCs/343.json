            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of block.timestamp in the onlyWhileOpen modifier creates a dependency on the current block timestamp to validate if the crowdsale is open. This allows miners to manipulate the timestamp, potentially allowing them to make transactions during unintended times.",
