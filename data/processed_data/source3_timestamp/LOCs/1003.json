            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The mint function's cooldown enforcement relies on block.timestamp, which is subject to manipulation by miners. This can allow miners to adjust the timestamp slightly to bypass the established cooldown period and mint tokens before the cooldown has actually expired.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Miners can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the block timestamp, allowing them to execute the mint function immediately after a previous mint, effectively minting more tokens than intended. This undermines the cooldown mechanism and could lead to excessive minting or flooding the market with tokens.",
            "fixedCode": "require(block.timestamp >= lastMintTime + MINT_COOLDOWN + TIME_TOLERANCE, \"Cooldown not over\"); // Add a buffer time tolerance to the cooldown enforcement"
