            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Miners could adjust the block timestamp to execute transactions at a time that is beneficial to them, potentially allowing them to circumvent rules intended to prevent certain actions until gameTime has passed. This could lead to unfair advantages and manipulation of the token sale mechanics.",
