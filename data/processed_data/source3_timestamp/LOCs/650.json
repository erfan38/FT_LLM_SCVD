            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function setEndTime uses 'now' (alias for block.timestamp) to compare the current time against both endTime and _endTime. This leads to a timestamp dependence vulnerability because miners can manipulate block timestamps, potentially altering the behavior of this function.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Miners may adjust the block timestamp to create a situation where the require checks succeed or fail, allowing them to manipulate the timing to their advantage. For instance, they could set _endTime to an undesired timeframe, potentially leading to financial losses or unfair advantages in the crowdsale.",
            "fixedCode": "require(block.timestamp < endTime); require(block.timestamp < _endTime); // Using block.timestamp directly and ensuring it is not easily manipulable."
