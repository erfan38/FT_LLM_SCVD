            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function _random() uses block.timestamp, which can be manipulated by miners to influence the outcome of the randomness. This makes the selection of the winner unreliable, as a miner could choose to mine a block during specific times to ensure a favorable outcome for themselves.",
