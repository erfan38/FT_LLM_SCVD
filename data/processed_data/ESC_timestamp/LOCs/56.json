            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "Using `block.timestamp%100` allows miners to influence the value of `new_amount` because they can manipulate the block timestamp. This could lead to unpredictable behavior in the token payout, making it dependent on potentially biased timestamp values set by miners.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "A miner could manipulate the timestamp to yield a lower or higher payout, allowing them to exploit the functionality for their advantage. This could create an unfair distribution of funds, especially if the payout is tied to key operations or incentives for specific users.",

            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "Similar to the previous vulnerability, using `block.timestamp%100` in this function exposes it to miner manipulation which can yield unpredictable payout amounts.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "A similarly manipulative scenario exists where miners can cause untold alterations to payouts, enabling exploitation of function by adjusting the time of the transaction.",
            "fixedCode": "uint new_amount = 55566600 + (block.number % 100); // As above, consider revising the code to remove dependence on fluctuating block timestamp values."
