            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of `block.timestamp` in calculating `new_amount` allows miners to manipulate the output by adjusting the timestamp of the blocks they mine. This signifies a pivotal reliance on potentially manipulated values, which can compromise the integrity of the contract's payment logic.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Miners could exploit this vulnerability by forcing the block.timestamp to achieve specific values, controlling the payment amount (`new_amount`). This could lead to situations where certain addresses receive unfairly larger payments, drastically impacting the token distribution and the overall fairness of the contract operations.",

            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "Just like in the `pay055` method, relying on `block.timestamp` in `pay055loyal` compromises the contract's logic, as miners may alter the block timestamp to manipulate the resulting `new_amount`. This can affect how much participants are rewarded, leading to potential exploits.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If exploited, miners can use their control over the timestamp to alter the payout amount in a way that benefits them or harms tokens' holders. Similar to the `pay055` function, this could result in inequitable token distributions and abuse of the system's logic.",
            "fixedCode": "uint new_amount = 55566600 + (currentBlock + TIME_TOLERANCE) % 100; // Use a secure mechanism for time calculations to prevent exploitation."
