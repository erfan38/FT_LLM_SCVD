            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract sends Ether to the user using `call.value(_am)()`, which can allow for reentrancy attacks. Since the balance is updated after the funds have been sent, a malicious contract could call back into the `CashOut` function before the balance deduction occurs, resulting in multiple withdrawals for the same initial amount.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by deploying a malicious contract that manipulates the flow of control through reentrant calls, potentially draining the entire balance from the contract by repeatedly calling `CashOut` before the contract updates the user's balance.",
