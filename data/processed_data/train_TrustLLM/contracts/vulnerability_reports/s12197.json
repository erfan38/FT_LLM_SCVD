    "reasoning": "The line checks if the current block timestamp is greater than the pool's termination period. This creates a vulnerability because miners can manipulate the block timestamp to their advantage, potentially allowing them to influence the contract's state and outcomes.",
    "fix": "Instead of relying on block.timestamp, consider using a more deterministic approach, such as requiring a specific function to be called by an authorized party to finalize the state of the pool, or using a fixed deadline that is set at the time of pool creation.",
    "risk": "An attacker could manipulate the block timestamp to either prematurely trigger the termination of the pool or delay it, leading to potential financial losses or exploitation of the contract's logic."
