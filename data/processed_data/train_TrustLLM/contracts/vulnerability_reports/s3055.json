    "reasoning": "The line checks if the 'deadline' is less than the current block timestamp. This creates a vulnerability because an attacker can manipulate the transaction timing to their advantage, potentially allowing them to bypass the deadline check.",
    "fix": "Instead of relying on block.timestamp, consider using a more deterministic approach, such as requiring the deadline to be a fixed duration from the current block number, or using a trusted oracle for timekeeping.",
    "risk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a transaction just before the deadline, knowing that they can manipulate the timing to their advantage, potentially allowing them to execute actions that should have been restricted by the deadline."
