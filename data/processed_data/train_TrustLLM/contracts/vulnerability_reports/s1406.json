    "reasoning": "The line checks if the current block timestamp is greater than the activation time plus a grace period. This creates a dependency on block.timestamp, which can be manipulated by miners to some extent, allowing them to influence the outcome of the condition.",
    "fix": "Replace the dependency on block.timestamp with a more reliable mechanism, such as using a predefined deadline or a block number that is not easily manipulated.",
    "risk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the block timestamp to bypass the requirement, allowing them to withdraw funds even when they should not be eligible."
