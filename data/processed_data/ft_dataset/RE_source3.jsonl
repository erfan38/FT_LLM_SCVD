It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\n#### How to fix Reentrancy vulnerable code:\n\n# ** 1-Using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**\nThis pattern ensures that contract state updates (effects) occur before any external interaction, preventing reentrant calls from manipulating balances before they are updated.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmsg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");  //  vulnerable: External call before state update\nbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;      //  vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer (vulnerable)\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;      //  fixed: Update balance first (Effects)\n(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");  // fixed: External call after state update (Interactions)\nrequire(success, \"Transfer failed\");  // fixed:  Ensure successful transfer\n\n# **2- Using the Withdrawal Pattern (Pull Payments)**\nInstead of sending Ether directly within a function, store the funds in a mapping and allow users to withdraw later, preventing direct reentrancy.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif (!msg.sender.send(_amount)) {   // Vulnerable: Sends Ether directly to msg.sender\n    revert(\"Transfer failed\");\n}\nbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;   // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\nmapping(address => uint256) public pendingWithdrawals;\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction withdraw() public {\n    uint256 amount = pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender];  \n    require(amount > 0, \"No funds to withdraw\");  \n\n    pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] = 0;  // Fixed: Update balance first (Effects)\n\n    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}(\"\");  // Fixed: External call after state update (Interactions)\n    require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n}\n\nfunction deposit() public payable {\n    pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n}\n\n# **3- Use a Reentrancy Guard**\nA reentrancy guard prevents multiple reentrant calls by locking the function during execution.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n\nfunction withdraw(uint256 _amount) external {\n    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");  // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n    require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n\n    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol\";\n\ncontract SecureContract is ReentrancyGuard {\n    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n\n    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external nonReentrant {\n        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Fixed: Update state before external call\n\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n    }\n}\n\n# **4- Gas-Limited Transfers to Reduce Reentrancy Risk**\nWhile .call{value: amount}(\"\") is recommended for most cases, the transfer() function can sometimes be a safer option because it limits gas to 2300, preventing complex reentrant attacks.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n\nfunction withdraw(uint256 _amount) external {\n    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");  // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n    require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n\n    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nmapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n\nfunction withdraw(uint256 _amount) external {\n    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Fixed: Update state before external call\n\n    payable(msg.sender).transfer(_amount);  // Fixed: Uses transfer to prevent

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\n#### How to fix Reentrancy vulnerable code:\n\n# ** 1-Using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**\nThis pattern ensures that contract state updates (effects) occur before any external interaction, preventing reentrant calls from manipulating balances before they are updated.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmsg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");

 // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n    require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n\n    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol\";\n\ncontract SecureContract is ReentrancyGuard {\n    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n\n    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external nonReentrant {\n        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions.

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\n#### How to fix Reentrancy vulnerable code:\n\n# ** 1-Using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**\nThis pattern ensures that contract state updates (effects) occur before any external interaction, preventing reentrant calls from manipulating balances before they are updated.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmsg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\n#### How to fix Reentrancy vulnerable code:\n\n# ** 1-Using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**\nThis pattern ensures that contract state updates (effects) occur before any external interaction, preventing reentrant calls from manipulating balances before they are updated.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmsg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");  //  vulnerable: External call before state update\nbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;      //  vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer (vulnerable)\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;      //  fixed: Update balance first (Effects)\n(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");  // fixed: External call after state update (Interactions)\nrequire(success, \"Transfer failed\");  // fixed:  Ensure successful transfer\n\n# **2- Using the Withdrawal Pattern (Pull Payments)**\nInstead of sending Ether directly within a function, store the funds in a mapping and allow users to withdraw later, preventing direct reentrancy.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif (!msg.sender.send(_amount)) {   // Vulnerable: Sends Ether directly to msg.sender\n    revert(\"Transfer failed\");\n}\nbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;   // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\nmapping(address => uint256) public pendingWithdrawals;\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction withdraw() public {\n    uint256 amount = pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender];  \n    require(amount > 0, \"No funds to withdraw\");  \n\n    pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] = 0;  // Fixed: Update balance first (Effects)\n\n    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}(\"\");  // Fixed: External call after state update (Interactions)\n    require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n}\n\nfunction deposit() public payable {\n    pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n}\n\n# **3- Use a Reentrancy Guard**\nA reentrancy guard prevents multiple reentrant calls by locking the function during execution.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n\nfunction withdraw(uint256 _amount) external {\n    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");  // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n    require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n\n    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol\";\n\ncontract SecureContract is ReentrancyGuard {\n    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n\n    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external nonReentrant {\n        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Fixed: Update state before external call\n\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n    }\n}\n\n# **4- Gas-Limited Transfers to Reduce Reentrancy Risk**\nWhile .call{value: amount}(\"\") is recommended for most cases, the transfer() function can sometimes be a safer option because it limits gas to 2300, preventing complex reentrant attacks.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n\nfunction withdraw(uint256 _amount) external {\n    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\n#### How to fix Reentrancy vulnerable code:\n\n# ** 1-Using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**\nThis pattern ensures that contract state updates (effects) occur before any external interaction, preventing reentrant calls from manipulating balances before they are updated.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmsg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions.
