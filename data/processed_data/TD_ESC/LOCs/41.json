            "vulnerabilityReason": "The `getRandom` function utilizes `block.timestamp` and `block.difficulty` to generate a random number. Since miners have the ability to manipulate these values, they can influence the randomness of the generated number, leading to predictable outcomes that can be exploited.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "A malicious miner could manipulate the timestamp or difficulty of the block to generate favorable random numbers, causing unfair advantages in gameplay dynamics, such as outcomes of battles or scarce item generation.

            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of `block.blockhash` in conjunction with `block.number` as a seed for randomness is susceptible to miner manipulation. Miners can control the blockhashes of recent blocks, allowing them to dictate the output of functions dependent on them.",
