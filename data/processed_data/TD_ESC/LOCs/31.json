            "vulnerabilityReason": "The calculation of unclaimed rewards depends on `block.timestamp`, making it vulnerable to miner manipulation, as miners can tweak the timestamp at which they mine blocks. This allows them to influence how many rewards a player can claim based on their control over the mining time.",
