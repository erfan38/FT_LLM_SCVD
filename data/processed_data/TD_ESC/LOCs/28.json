            "vulnerabilityReason": "Using 'block.timestamp%100' to determine part of the amount introduces a timestamp dependence vulnerability. Miners can manipulate the `block.timestamp`, which can result in unfair distribution of funds based on the manipulated timestamp value.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "As miners can control the block timestamp within a certain range, they could exploit this vulnerability to influence the payout amounts, leading to potentially arbitrary and unfair distributions. This can affect the integrity of fund distributions and the reliability of the contract's financial logic.",

            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The same dependency on block.timestamp is present again, making the calculation of `new_amount` vulnerable to miner manipulation. This repeated vulnerability indicates that the logic applied here can be detrimentally affected by a minerâ€™s control over block timestamps.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Similar to the previous vulnerability, miners can manipulate the `block.timestamp` to influence the payout, resulting in unequal outcomes for contract participants. This kind of manipulation could lead to unfair economic advantages for parties aware of the contract's mechanics.",
