            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of `block.timestamp` to compute `bonusHash` enables miners to manipulate the bonus token issuance logic. Miners can adjust the timestamps of the blocks they mine, allowing them to influence the bonus multiplier unfairly.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "A miner could exploit this vulnerability by setting a favorable timestamp, leading to higher bonus token issuance that could be unfairly gained. This could result in a disproportionate allocation of tokens to certain users, subverting the intended token distribution mechanism.",
            "fixedCode": "// Replace block.timestamp with a different source of randomness to mitigate miner manipulation, such as using blockhash of previous blocks, if feasible. Alternatively, introduce a time tolerance or a strict cutoff for bonus calculations."
