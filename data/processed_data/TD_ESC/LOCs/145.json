            "vulnerabilityReason": "The usage of block.timestamp implies that the function execution is dependent on the current time, which can be controlled by miners. This creates a vulnerability as miners can manipulate timestamps when they mine blocks, potentially allowing them to influence the execution of the 'party' function.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Miners could exploit this vulnerability by adjusting the timestamp to either prevent users from calling the 'party' function at the intended time or to allow it when it would normally be restricted. This manipulation can undermine the intended release of funds, affecting all hodlers dependent on the timing of the 'party' function execution.",
            "fixedCode": "require (block.number >= (partyTime / 15 + TIME_TOLERANCE) && hodlers[msg.sender] > 0); // or similar using block.number to avoid timestamp dependence."
