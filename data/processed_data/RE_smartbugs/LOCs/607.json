            "vulnerabilityReason": "The external call to `whale.call.value(amount)(...)` occurs before updating the state variable `totalDonated`. This allows an attacker to execute a reentrancy attack on the `donateToWhale` function during the external call, enabling them to manipulate the state and withdraw more than their intended amount.",

It can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds or manipulate the state, resulting in unexpected behavior.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Repeated invocation of the `loseWager` function can enable an attacker to withdraw more Ether than intended, as their state wouldn't be reflected until after the Ether is sent, posing a serious security risk to the contract's funds.",
