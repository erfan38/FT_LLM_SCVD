            "vulnerabilityReason": "The code calls `Transactions[TransHash].destination.call.value(Transactions[TransHash].value)(Transactions[TransHash].data)` before marking the transaction as executed. This allows an attacker to exploit reentrancy by calling back into `executeTransaction` before the state variable `executed` is set to true, potentially leading to multiple executions of the same transaction.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could repeatedly invoke the external contract before the previous transaction state is updated, thus enabling them to drain funds from the contract by executing the same transaction multiple times without legitimate confirmation.",
