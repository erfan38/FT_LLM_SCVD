            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of `call.value(_amount)()` sends Ether to the caller before updating the balance state. This allows an attacker to re-enter the `withdraw` function and call it again before the original withdrawal is recorded, potentially allowing them to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a contract that makes recursive calls to `withdraw`, draining the contract's funds by repeatedly withdrawing the same Ether before the state variable `balances[msg.sender]` is decremented.",
