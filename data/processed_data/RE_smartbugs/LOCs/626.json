            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of `call.value()` sends Ether to the sale contract and the manager before setting the `paid` variable to true. This allows a potential reentrant call from either address before the state variable is updated, making it possible for an attacker to recursively withdraw funds during this process.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could construct a malicious contract and manipulate it to re-enter the `pay()` function, draining the ICOStartReservation contract of its funds since the checks to prevent re-entrance are performed after the funds are sent.",
