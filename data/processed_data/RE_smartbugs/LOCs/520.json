            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function _finalizePreviousRoll is called to handle payouts after making external calls. If an attacker exploits this by re-entering the function during the external call, the contract's state could be manipulated before it can finalize the previous roll and clear the user's records, leading to potential attack scenarios.",

            "vulnerabilityReason": "This line updates the total won amount without ensuring the transfer to the user is successful first. Thus, if the transfer fails, the contract state reflects that a payout was made when in reality it wasn't, which can be exploited.",

            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of msg.sender.call to send Ether creates vulnerabilities due to the possibility of reentrancy attacks since the state is updated after the external call, allowing potential manipulation of contract state prior to the update.",
