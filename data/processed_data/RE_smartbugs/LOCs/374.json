            "vulnerabilityReason": "The safeTransfer function call is made after the local state (user's token balance) is already modified, which could allow an attacker to manipulate the contract state before the transfer is completed.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If the token contract being transferred to allows for changing the state (like registering a withdrawal), an attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious contract that calls withdrawToken to withdraw more tokens than intended, effectively stealing funds from the contract.",
