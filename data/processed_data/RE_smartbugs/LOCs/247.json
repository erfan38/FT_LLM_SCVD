            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of call.value() without verifying if the transaction was successful and updating the executed status first allows for a reentrancy attack, where an attacker could call back into the contract during the external call before the state changes occur.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to drain the contract's funds by repeatedly triggering the executeTransaction function, as the state regarding executed transactions would not be updated until after the funds have been sent.",
