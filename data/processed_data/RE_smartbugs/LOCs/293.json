Although the balance is updated first here, the trustworthiness of the external contract is not guaranteed.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If the receiver contract is malicious, it can exploit this to conduct unauthorized actions or invoke further transactions, eventually draining assets or causing unintended behavior within the contract.",
