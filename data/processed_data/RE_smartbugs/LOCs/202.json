            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of `call.value()` allows for an external call to be made to `comBankAddr_` without changing the contract state beforehand. If the call fails, the external contract can execute arbitrary code, allowing a reentrant call before any internal state has been updated in this contract.",

            "vulnerabilityReason": "In the `withdraw` function, the earnings are withdrawn before resetting the relevant player state variables. This allows an attacker to call into `withdrawEarnings` again and manipulate the earnings before the state is updated.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can repeatedly invoke the `withdraw` function during the external call to `withdrawEarnings`, potentially draining the contract's funds by executing multiple withdrawals before the state reflects the changes.",

            "vulnerabilityReason": "The `buyCore` function is called before any internal bookkeeping is updated (e.g., modifying the player's state or the round state). This could allow external contracts to re-enter and exploit the state of the contract before it's settled.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Similar to others, a malicious actor could execute a reentrant call in `buyCore`, potentially leading to excessive spending or manipulation of the contract's state affecting other players.",
