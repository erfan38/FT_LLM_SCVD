            "vulnerabilityReason": "The require statement checks for underflow by ensuring that the balance after subtraction is non-negative. However, this does not prevent underflow, because if balances[msg.sender] is less than _value, the subtraction will cause the balance to wrap around to a very large number due to the unsigned integer nature of the `balances` mapping.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this by having a negative balance (due to underflow) and transferring more tokens than they should, effectively gaining tokens without sufficient balance, compromising the integrity of the token system.",
