            "vulnerabilityReason": "The line subtracts 'input' from 'count' without ensuring that 'input' is less than or equal to 'count'. This can lead to underflow if 'input' is greater than 'count', causing 'count' to wrap around to a very large number due to Solidity's lack of built-in overflow checks in versions prior to 0.8.0.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by passing a value of 'input' larger than 'count', resulting in an unintended large value for 'count', which could disrupt expected behavior of the contract and allow potential manipulation of contract state.",
            "fixedCode": "require(count >= input, \"Underflow detected\"); // Ensure count does not underflow\ncount -= input; // Safe subtraction"
