            "vulnerabilityReason": "The addition operation 'count += input;' does not check if the resulting value exceeds the maximum value that uint can hold. If 'input' is large enough, it will cause an integer overflow, wrapping the value of 'count' back to a small number.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this by sending a crafted input that causes the count to overflow, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors in the contract, such as bypassing conditions that rely on the value of count or causing the contract to behave incorrectly.",
