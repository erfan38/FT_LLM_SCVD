            "vulnerabilityReason": "The subtraction operation `map[k] -= v` does not check if `map[k]` is greater than or equal to `v`. If `v` is greater than the current value of `map[k]`, this will cause an integer underflow, wrapping around to a very large number.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this by passing a value for `v` that exceeds `map[k]`, causing an underflow. This results in an unintended value for `map[k]`, potentially allowing the attacker to manipulate the mapping to gain access to more resources or tokens than intended.",
