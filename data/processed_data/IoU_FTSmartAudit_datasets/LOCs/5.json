            "vulnerabilityReason": "The code performs a subtraction of `input` from `count` without any checks. If `input` is greater than `count`, it will cause an underflow, resulting in `res` wrapping around to a very large value.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing an `input` value greater than `count`, leading to an unintended large value of `res`, which can introduce unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in subsequent logic that uses `res`.",
