            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of block.timestamp in calculating timeElapsed makes the contract highly sensitive to miner manipulation. Miners can slightly alter the timestamps when they create blocks, potentially inflating the reward calculations based on the manipulated time elapsed.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Miners could artificially inflate the rewards by manipulating the block timestamp during their mining process, resulting in users receiving excessive rewards for their staking amount. This undermines the fairness of the reward distribution system and could lead to significant financial loss for the contract owner.",
