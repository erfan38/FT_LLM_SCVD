            "vulnerabilityReason": "The claimReward function checks if the current block.timestamp is greater than the last claim time plus 1 day to enforce a 24-hour waiting period. This reliance on block.timestamp introduces a risk that can be exploited by miners, who can manipulate the timestamp to bypass the waiting period.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If a miner alters the block.timestamp, they could allow multiple claims in a 24-hour period, leading to unintended distribution of rewards. This compromises the intended limit on claim frequency, impacting the economics and fairness of the reward system.",
            "fixedCode": "require(block.timestamp >= lastClaimTime[msg.sender] + 1 days + TIME_TOLERANCE, \"Wait 24 hours between claims\"); // Adding a TIME_TOLERANCE to mitigate minable timestamp effects."
