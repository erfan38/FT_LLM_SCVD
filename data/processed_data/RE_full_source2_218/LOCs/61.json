            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious contract that, when receiving Ether, calls back into the 'claim_reward' function, allowing them to withdraw funds multiple times before the state of 'parameters['price_pool']' is correctly updated, which can lead to a drained contract balance.",
