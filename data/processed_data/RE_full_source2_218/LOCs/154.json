            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function uses `call.value(_amount)()` to send Ether to `msg.sender` before updating the state of the user's balance. This allows an external contract to execute arbitrary code when it receives Ether, leading to potential reentrancy attacks.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "A malicious user could create a contract that calls the `withdraw` function repeatedly before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain funds from the victim contract by withdrawing more than they are entitled to.",
