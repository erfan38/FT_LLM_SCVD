This allows the funding account to execute arbitrary code, which can lead to reentrancy attacks. If 'fundingAccount' is a malicious contract, it can call back into the 'buy' function before the balance is updated, allowing the contract to be drained.",

This would allow the attacker to withdraw multiple times within a single transaction, potentially draining the entire balance of the contract.",
