            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract uses `call.value(balances[msg.sender])()` to send Ether to the caller without updating the state first. This allows a malicious contract to re-enter the `get` function before balances are updated, potentially allowing the attacker to call this function multiple times and drain funds from the contract.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this function by deploying a malicious contract that calls `get`. Since the state isn't updated before the Ether is sent, they could repeatedly withdraw their balance until it is exhausted.",
            "fixedCode": "balances[msg.sender] = 0; // Update state first\nrequire(msg.sender.call.value(balances[msg.sender])()); // Send Ether after state update"
