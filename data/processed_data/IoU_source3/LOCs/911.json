            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function performs arithmetic operations involving multiplication and addition without any checks for overflow. Specifically, multiplying `block.number` by 10 could produce a large value, and when added to `totalSupply`, the result could exceed the maximum uint256 value, leading to an overflow and potentially wrapping around to zero or negative numbers.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This overflow can lead to incorrect calculations of the `totalSupply`, disrupting the token's economic model, and could allow for unintended behavior in the token supply management. This might result in incorrect valuations or exploitation of the token's inflation mechanism.",
            "fixedCode": "require(totalSupply + (block.number * 10) >= totalSupply, 'Overflow detected');\nreturn totalSupply + (block.number * 10);"
