                "totalTokens = totalTokens - amount;"
            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The 'burnTokens' function performs a subtraction on 'totalTokens' without validating that 'totalTokens' is greater than or equal to 'amount'. This lack of a check can lead to an integer underflow if 'amount' exceeds 'totalTokens', causing 'totalTokens' to wrap around and become a very large number due to the properties of unsigned integers in Solidity.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to burn more tokens than exist, artificially inflating 'totalTokens' and potentially gaining more token privileges than intended, which may impact the overall token economy and allow the attacker to manipulate the balance erroneously.",
            "fixedCode": "function burnTokens(uint amount) public returns (uint) { require(totalTokens >= amount, 'Insufficient tokens to burn'); totalTokens = totalTokens - amount; return totalTokens; }"
