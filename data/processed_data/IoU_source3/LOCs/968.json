            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract calculates `totalReward` by multiplying `_baseReward` and `_multiplier`. If both values are large enough, their product can exceed the maximum limit for a `uint`, resulting in an overflow. This behavior can lead to incorrect reward calculations, resulting in smaller rewards than intended or other unexpected behavior.",

The contract could unintentionally award significantly lower rewards than meant, thus undermining trust in the reward system.",
