            "vulnerabilityReason": "The multiplication of `_tokens` and `_multiplier` without any checks for overflow can lead to an integer overflow if both values are sufficiently large. In Solidity prior to version 0.8.0, overflowing during multiplication can result in unexpected behavior, giving erroneous values of `votingPower`.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could manipulate the inputs such that the multiplication overflows, potentially assigning incorrect voting power, which may result in users gaining too much or too little voting rights, ultimately distorting the voting outcome.",
            "fixedCode": "uint votingPower = _tokens * _multiplier;\nrequire(votingPower / _tokens == _multiplier, \"Overflow detected\"); // Ensures no overflow occurred before assigning the value."
