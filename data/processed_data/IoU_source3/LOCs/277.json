            "vulnerabilityReason": "The calculation for `_amount` involves multiplying `mintedAmount` by `10 ** uint256(decimals)`. If either `mintedAmount` or `decimals` is sufficiently large, this could cause an overflow in the resulting `_amount`, particularly since `decimals` affects the multiplier, potentially leading to extremely large numbers that exceed the maximum for a `uint256`.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An overflow in the `_amount` could lead to incorrect values being stored in `balanceOf` and `totalSupply`. This would compromise the integrity of the token's supply, allowing the contract owner to mint more tokens than intended, causing inflation, and possibly leading to loss of funds for users as the total supply becomes invalid.",
            "fixedCode": "require(mintedAmount <= MAX_UINT256 / (10 ** uint256(decimals)), \"Minted amount too high to prevent overflow\");\nuint256 _amount = mintedAmount * (10 ** uint256(decimals));"
