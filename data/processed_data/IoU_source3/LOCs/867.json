            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function `spendCoins` subtracts `coins` from `totalCoins` without verifying if `totalCoins` is greater than or equal to `coins`. If `coins` exceeds `totalCoins`, this operation will result in an integer underflow, causing `totalCoins` to wrap around to a large value.",
