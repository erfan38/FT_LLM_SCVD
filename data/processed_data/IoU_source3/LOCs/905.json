            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function subtracts 'block.timestamp' from 'offerEndTime' without checking if 'block.timestamp' is greater than 'offerEndTime'. If the offer has ended, this can lead to an underflow, resulting in an incorrect and potentially very large return value.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability could lead to incorrect remaining time calculations, potentially allowing users to misinterpret the duration of an offer that has ended, which can impact decision-making and automation processes reliant on accurate time metrics.",
