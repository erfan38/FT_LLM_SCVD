            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The multiplication 'votesFor * 100' could overflow if 'votesFor' is sufficiently large (greater than MAX_UINT256/100). Additionally, the calculation involves a division by (votesFor + votesAgainst), which can lead to division by zero if both 'votesFor' and 'votesAgainst' are zero, resulting in a runtime error.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "These vulnerabilities could lead to incorrect calculations of percentages, resulting in misleading information for users. The overflow could cause the contract to behave unexpectedly, while division by zero would revert transactions and lead to denial of service for users attempting to retrieve percentages.",
            "fixedCode": "require(votesFor + votesAgainst > 0, 'No votes cast.');\nrequire(votesFor <= (type(uint256).max / 100), 'Vote overflow.');\nreturn (votesFor * 100) / (votesFor + votesAgainst);"
