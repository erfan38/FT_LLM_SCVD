            "vulnerabilityReason": "The multiplication operation between `result` and `_factor` does not check for potential overflow. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, if `result * _factor` exceeds the maximum value of uint32 (2^32-1), it wraps around without error, leading to incorrect results. Though Solidity 0.8.0 introduces built-in overflow checks, it's still considered poor practice to rely solely on these without explicit checks for critical computations.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If the multiplication results in an overflow, the `result` will wrap around to a potentially small incorrect value. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the contract's logic, allowing for unintended consequences such as manipulation of contract states or calculations. Ultimately, it could lead to the loss of funds or failures in contract operations.",
            "fixedCode": "require(_factor > 0, \"Factor must be greater than zero\"); require(result <= (type(uint32).max / _factor), \"Multiplication would overflow\"); result = result * _factor;"
