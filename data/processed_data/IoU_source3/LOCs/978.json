            "vulnerabilityReason": "The subtraction operation `_currentYear - _birthYear` can cause an underflow if `_birthYear` is greater than `_currentYear`. This results in the `age` variable receiving an incorrect (usually very large) value due to underflow, which can lead to false validations when checking if a user is an adult.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this by entering a future birth year, resulting in an underflow. This would allow underage individuals to bypass age verification checks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to age-restricted features or services.",
            "fixedCode": "require(_currentYear >= _birthYear, \"Invalid birth year\");\nuint age = _currentYear - _birthYear;"
