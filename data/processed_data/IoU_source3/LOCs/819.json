            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function performs the modulus operation using int8 variables where the value of 'a' is -128 and 'b' is -1. The modulus operation can lead to an overflow/underflow condition because the calculation of -128 % -1 in the context of an unsigned result may yield unexpected results due to the limits of int8, especially prior to Solidity 0.8. Such calculations may not handle range correctly, leading to potential unexpected behaviors.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability can result in unexpected results or denial-of-service due to transaction reverts when the modulus operation exceeds the int8 range. Prior to Solidity 0.8.0, this would cause silent overflows, potentially altering control flow or introducing security risks.",
            "fixedCode": "function mod_underflow() public pure returns (int8) { int8 a = -128; int8 b = -1; require(b != 0, 'Division by zero'); return a % b; }"
