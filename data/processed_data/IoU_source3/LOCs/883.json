            "vulnerabilityReason": "This line calculates the 'vested' tokens based on the difference between the current block timestamp and the 'vestingStart'. If 'vestingStart' is set to a future timestamp (i.e., a time greater than the current timestamp), the result of the subtraction will underflow, leading to a very large number being assigned to 'vested'.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Such an underflow could allow a user to claim a significantly larger amount of tokens than intended, as the calculation would result in a negative value being interpreted as a large positive uint256 value. This could lead to unauthorized access to tokens and significant financial losses for the token vesting system.",
