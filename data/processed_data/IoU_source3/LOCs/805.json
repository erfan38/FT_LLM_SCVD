            "vulnerabilityReason": "The operation '(1 + rate)' is calculated and stored in a uint8, which can only hold values up to 255. If 'rate' is greater than 254%, this expression will overflow. Additionally, exponentiation '** time' can result in extremely large values very quickly, which can also overflow uint8. Finally, multiplying the potentially large result with 'principal' (a uint32) can further lead to overflow issues as the product may exceed the maximum value of uint32 (2^32 - 1).",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Incorrect calculations due to overflows could lead to significantly lower interest values being returned, resulting in financial manipulation opportunities. An attacker could exploit this by setting high rates or times to force an overflow, thus minimizing the calculated interest and resulting in the contract giving out less than intended, potentially leading to forced liquidations or contract insolvency.",
