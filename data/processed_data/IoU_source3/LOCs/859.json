            "vulnerabilityReason": "The addition operation `totalPoints + points` does not check for integer overflow. If a large value for `points` is passed, the operation could exceed the maximum value of uint, causing `totalPoints` to wrap around and potentially leading to unintended behavior.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passing an excessively large value for `points`, resulting in an incorrect total points calculation. This could allow manipulation of the points system, leading to unauthorized rewards or allowances.",
            "fixedCode": "require(totalPoints + points >= totalPoints, 'Overflow detected');\ntotalPoints = totalPoints + points; // using require statement to check for overflow."
