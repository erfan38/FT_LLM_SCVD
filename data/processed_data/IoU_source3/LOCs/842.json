                "lastBlockNumber = block.number + 1;"
            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function `updateBlockNumber` adds 1 to the current `block.number` without checking if this addition might cause an overflow. If `block.number` is at its maximum value of uint256, adding 1 would wrap around to 0 in Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, which can lead to incorrect state management.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Although the practical likelihood of reaching the maximum value of `block.number` is extremely minimal, this vulnerability could result in unexpected behavior, such as resetting `lastBlockNumber` to 0, which could disrupt logic that relies on tracking block numbers and potentially lead to incorrect conditions or state in the contract.",
            "fixedCode": "if (block.number < type(uint256).max) { lastBlockNumber = block.number + 1; } else { revert('Block number overflow'); }"
