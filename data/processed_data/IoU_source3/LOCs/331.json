If `_value` is greater than the current `releaseamount[msg.sender]` or `balances[msg.sender]`, this will cause an underflow. Similarly, if `balances[_to]` exceeds the maximum value of uint256 after adding `_value`, it will overflow.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this by transferring more tokens than they possess, leading to an underflow, potentially allowing unauthorized transfers or a situation where the user's balance or release amount becomes negative. This could enable theft or manipulation of funds, resulting in financial losses.",
