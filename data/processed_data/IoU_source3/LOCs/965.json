                "uint totalTokens = _tokens * _multiplier;"
            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The `multiplyTokens` function multiplies `_tokens` with `_multiplier` without checks for overflow. Since both are of type `uint`, if their product exceeds the maximum value representable by a `uint` (2^256 - 1), it will wrap around to 0, leading to incorrect calculations.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability could lead to tokens being incorrectly calculated, resulting in either a failure to issue tokens properly or even issuing fewer tokens than expected. This can cause users to receive less value and can be exploited if an attacker manipulates input values.",
            "fixedCode": "using SafeMath for uint;  \nuint totalTokens = _tokens.mul(_multiplier); // Using SafeMath to handle multiplication safely."
