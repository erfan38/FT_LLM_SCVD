            "vulnerabilityReason": "The multiplication operation 'result *= base' inside a loop does not check for potential overflow. If 'base' or 'exponent' is large enough, the resulting value of 'result' may exceed the maximum limit for unsigned integers (uint256), causing overflow and leading to incorrect results.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An overflow could cause the function to return a value that is significantly smaller than the expected result, allowing for unintended behavior in any application logic relying on the output of this function, which could lead to incorrect calculations and potential exploitation by malicious users.",
            "fixedCode": "if(result <= type(uint256).max / base) { result *= base; } else { revert('Overflow detected'); } // This ensures that multiplication will not overflow before it happens."
