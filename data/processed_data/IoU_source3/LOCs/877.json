                "uint256 power = block.timestamp - membershipStart;"
            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The calculation of `power` involves subtracting `membershipStart` from `block.timestamp`. If `membershipStart` is greater than `block.timestamp`, this results in an underflow, yielding a very large number instead of a valid voting power, potentially allowing an attacker to gain excessive voting rights.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could manipulate the `membershipStart` value to a future timestamp, leading to an unintentionally high voting power. This undermines the integrity of the voting system, allowing for potential exploitation or manipulation of voting outcomes.",
