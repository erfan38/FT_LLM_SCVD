            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract performs arithmetic operations such as multiplication and addition without checking for overflow. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, multiplying `ticketPrice` by `numberOfTickets` can result in an overflow if both values are sufficiently large, making the calculation inaccurate. Similarly, adding `msg.value` to `totalPool` can also overflow if the total pool becomes too large, leading to incorrect state changes in the contract.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing an overflow in the payment calculation, which could enable them to buy more tickets than they have paid for or manipulate the total pool to an incorrect value.",
            "fixedCode": "require(msg.value >= ticketPrice * numberOfTickets, \"Insufficient payment\");\nrequire(ticketPrice * numberOfTickets >= ticketPrice, \"Multiplication overflow\");\nrequire(totalPool + msg.value >= totalPool, \"Total pool overflow\");\ntotalPool += msg.value; // Safe addition, protected by the require check."
