                "uint256 tokensToRelease = totalTokens * period / vestingPeriods;"

            "vulnerabilityReason": "The multiplication operation between `totalTokens` and `period` in the expression could lead to an integer overflow if both values are large enough. In Solidity, integer overflow occurs when a calculation exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a variable, resulting in unexpected behavior.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability could lead to releasing more tokens than intended if the overflow causes `tokensToRelease` to wrap around to a smaller number or an unintended incorrect calculation, potentially affecting the distribution of tokens and financial loss for stakeholders.",
            "fixedCode": "// Using Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow protection or SafeMath for older versions:\nrequire(totalTokens > 0 && period > 0, 'Invalid inputs');\nuint256 tokensToRelease = (totalTokens * period) / vestingPeriods; // Safe as divisions are handled after ensuring no overflow."
