Exponentiation grows very quickly, and values can easily surpass this limit, leading to unexpected results or overflow.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If 'power' exceeds the maximum value for a uint64, it will wrap around to a smaller number, which can lead to incorrect logic and potential exploits, such as allowing unauthorized calculations or states in the contract. In Solidity versions <0.8.0, this would happen silently, leading to unintentional behaviors without any error message.",
