            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract performs arithmetic operations on `balances` without using SafeMath or built-in overflow checks in Solidity >=0.8. If the `balances[msg.sender]` is equal to `_value`, then subtracting `_value` will lead to an underflow and result in a large number being assigned to `balances[msg.sender]`. Additionally, if `balances[_to]` is at its maximum limit of uint256, adding `_value` could cause an overflow, which is not protected by any checks.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the balance to a negative value, allowing them to transfer more funds than they legitimately possess, resulting in potential loss of funds and invalid states in the contract.",

            "vulnerabilityReason": "The transferFrom function modifies `balances[_from]` and `allowed[_from][msg.sender]` without checks for underflow or overflow. If `_value` is greater than `balances[_from]`, it will result in an underflow, and if `allowed[_from][msg.sender]` is less than `_value`, a similar underflow can occur, leading to unexpected behavior in the contract.",
