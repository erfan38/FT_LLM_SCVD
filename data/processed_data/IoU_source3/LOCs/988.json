            "vulnerabilityReason": "The multiplication of `amount` and `rate` in the `exchange` function can result in an integer overflow if either `amount` or `rate` is sufficiently large. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, there are no automatic checks for overflow on arithmetic operations, meaning that if the product exceeds the maximum value of `uint`, it will wrap around to zero, leading to incorrect calculations.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inputting large values for `amount` and `rate`, causing a calculation that results in an overflow. This would yield an incorrect return value, potentially allowing users to trade more than expected, leading to financial losses.",
            "fixedCode": "require(amount <= type(uint).max / rate, \"Overflow detected\");\nreturn amount * rate; // Now safe due to the maximum check."
