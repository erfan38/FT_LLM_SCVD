            "vulnerabilityReason": "The multiplication operation 'totalReputation * _actionWeight' can result in an integer overflow if '_actionWeight' is sufficiently large. Since both `totalReputation` and `_actionWeight` are uint256 variables, a large enough `_actionWeight` could cause the result of the multiplication to exceed the maximum value for a uint256, wrapping around to a lower value and causing incorrect calculations.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability may lead to incorrect reputation assignments, where actions could receive either far too much or too little reputation impact than intended. It can potentially allow malicious users to exploit the system by assigning inflated reputation values to their actions, undermining the reputation system's integrity.",
            "fixedCode": "require(_actionWeight <= (type(uint256).max / totalReputation), 'Action weight too high to prevent overflow');\nreputationPerAction[currentAction] = (totalReputation * _actionWeight) / 1000; // Safeguarded multiplication"
