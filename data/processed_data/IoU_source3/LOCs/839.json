            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function `sumArray` performs an addition on `total` and `numbers[i]` without checking if the result will exceed the maximum value for a `uint16`. This can lead to an overflow if the sum of the elements in the `numbers` array exceeds 65,535. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, an overflow would not be reported but would cause `total` to wrap around to a smaller number. In versions 0.8.0 and later, the transaction would revert, but the check should still be performed for safety and graceful error handling.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An overflow could lead to incorrect calculations, resulting in `total` being much lower than expected. This can lead to scenarios where functions dependent on this total value produce incorrect or malicious outcomes, such as failing to meet expected logic in the contract or allowing unauthorized access if used in conditional statements.",
