            "vulnerabilityReason": "The multiplication of a large number (2^255 - 1) by 2 exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 type (2^256 - 1). In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, this operation would result in an overflow that occurs silently, potentially leading to incorrect results or unexpected behaviors. In versions 0.8.0 and later, such an overflow would cause the transaction to revert, but it's still classified as a vulnerability since it may lead to denial of service if not handled appropriately.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If an attacker executes this function with a value that causes an overflow, it could result in incorrect calculations and behaviors within the contract, leading to security vulnerabilities or unintended logic execution. It can also cause denial of service if the transaction is reverted unexpectedly in certain scenarios.",
            "fixedCode": "uint256 mul = (2**255 - 1) / 2; // Adjust to prevent overflow\nreturn mul * 2; // This will not cause an overflow."
