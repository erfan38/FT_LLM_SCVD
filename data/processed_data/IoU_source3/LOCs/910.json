            "vulnerabilityReason": "Adding 'block.timestamp' to 'lockupPeriod' without any checks can lead to an integer overflow when the result exceeds the maximum value of uint256. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the unlock timing by exploiting the overflow condition, which could lead to unlocking tokens earlier than intended.",
