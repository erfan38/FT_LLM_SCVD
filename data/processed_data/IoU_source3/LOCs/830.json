            "vulnerabilityReason": "The increment function adds 1 to the 'count' variable without checking for an overflow condition. Since 'count' is a uint8, it can only hold values from 0 to 255. When 'count' is 255 and the increment function is called, it will wrap around to 0, leading to unintended behavior. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, this overflow occurs silently, but in later versions, it will cause the transaction to revert. Both scenarios represent a vulnerability due to the lack of proper handling for this potential overflow.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by calling the 'increment' function when 'count' is already at its maximum value, leading to an unexpected wrap-around and incorrect state of the contract. This could potentially allow for unauthorized access or manipulation of contract logic dependent on the 'count' variable.",
