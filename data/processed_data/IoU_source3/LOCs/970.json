            "vulnerabilityReason": "The subtraction operation between `_endTime` and `_startTime` does not validate if `_startTime` is greater than `_endTime`. If `_startTime` is larger, the result will underflow, yielding a large unsigned integer instead of a negative value, leading to incorrect calculations of time difference.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An underflow could lead to returning a very large number for `timeDifference`, which could mislead users of the contract into believing that the time difference is valid. This can cause unexpected behaviors in subsequent calculations and decisions based on that value.",
