            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function adds two unsigned integers, 'a' and 'b', without checking if the addition will result in an overflow. If 'a + b' exceeds the maximum value of uint256 (2**256 - 1), the result will wrap around to a smaller number, leading to an incorrect average. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, this overflow may silently occur, resulting in unexpected outputs. Even in later versions, while the transaction may revert, the lack of proper overflow checking remains a design flaw.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by passing large values for 'a' and 'b' to produce a wrong average, either to manipulate contract logic or to extract unintended values. This could compromise the integrity of calculations or misinform users regarding the average output, potentially causing misinformation or unauthorized actions reliant on this average value.",
            "fixedCode": "require(a + b >= a, \"Overflow detected\");\nreturn (a + b) / 2; // Ensure the addition does not overflow before calculating the average."
