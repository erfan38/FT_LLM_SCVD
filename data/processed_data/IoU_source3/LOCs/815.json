This value exceeds the maximum storable value for uint32 (4,294,967,295), causing an overflow. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, this would yield an incorrect result, while in version 0.8.0 and later, it would revert the transaction.",

This could result in unexpected behavior, denial of service for users relying on this function, or financial losses if used in critical calculations or logic.",
