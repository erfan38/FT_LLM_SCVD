If '_rewardAmount' is large enough that the addition exceeds the maximum value of uint256, this will result in an overflow. The second line subtracts 'block.timestamp' from 'totalRewards'. If 'block.timestamp' is greater than 'totalRewards', this will cause an underflow, resulting in an erroneous large positive value for 'totalRewards'.",

Similarly, an underflow could result in a huge value for 'totalRewards', potentially disrupting reward distribution and leading to unauthorized access to rewards or funds.",
