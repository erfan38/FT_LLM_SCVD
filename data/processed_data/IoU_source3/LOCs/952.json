            "vulnerabilityReason": "The multiplication within the expression 'totalSupply * _amount' can lead to an integer overflow if '_amount' is sufficiently large. When multiplying two large integers, if the result exceeds the maximum uint256 value, it wraps around to zero or a smaller number, causing incorrect calculations.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An overflow in this operation may allow more tokens to be minted than intended, potentially leading to exploitation or manipulation within the token distribution mechanism. This can result in incorrect total supply calculations, undermining the integrity of the token system and allowing unauthorized minting of tokens.",
            "fixedCode": "require(_amount <= type(uint256).max / totalSupply, 'Amount too large, potential overflow');\nmaxAmountPer[curTimes] = (totalSupply * _amount) / 100; // This line remains, but must be safeguarded with checks."
