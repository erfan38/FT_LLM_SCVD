            "vulnerabilityReason": "The factorial computation in the 'calculate' function uses multiplication without any safeguards against overflow. Since factorials grow very quickly, multiplying `result` by `i` can exceed the maximum limit of uint64 (2^64-1). This can lead to integer overflow, where the result wraps around to a smaller value, resulting in incorrect outputs and behavior.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If the function is called with a sufficiently large `n`, it will produce an incorrect result due to overflow, potentially allowing attackers to exploit this by causing unexpected states in the smart contract. This can lead to incorrect calculations or other unexpected behaviors when relying on the output of this function.",
