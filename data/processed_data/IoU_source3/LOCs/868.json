            "vulnerabilityReason": "The code performs an addition operation on `totalXP` without checking for overflow. If `xp` is large enough, the addition could exceed the maximum value that a uint can hold (2^256 - 1), causing an overflow and wrapping around to a smaller number. This vulnerability allows for the possibility of exceeding the `levelCap` effectively, as the overflow could result in a totalXP that is less than expected.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this overflow by providing a large `xp` value, potentially allowing the player's totalXP to roll over and become a negative value or to unexpectedly low positive values. This could lead to unintended behavior in the game, allowing players to gain experience points beyond the intended limits, manipulating the game balance and player progression.",
            "fixedCode": "require(totalXP + xp >= totalXP, \"Overflow detected\");\ntotalXP = totalXP + xp;\n\n// Use SafeMath for older Solidity versions or Solidity 0.8+ which automatically checks for overflow."
