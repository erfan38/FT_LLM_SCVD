            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function attempts to subtract 1 from the minimum value (0) that can be stored in a uint256, which results in an underflow. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, this would wrap the value to the maximum uint256 value, thus leading to unexpected behavior. In versions 0.8.0 and later, this operation would revert the transaction, but it still represents a logical vulnerability as it could cause denial of service under certain circumstances.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This underflow can cause severe logical errors, allowing the function to return an unintended maximum value instead of causing a proper error for invalid operations. This could lead to unintended behavior in other parts of the contract that rely on the output of this function.",
