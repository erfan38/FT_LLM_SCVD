This can lead to integer overflow if the recipient's balance is already close to the maximum value.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by orchestrating a series of transfers that push the balances of their targets near the maximum uint256 limit. If the balance then overflows, the recipient could unintentionally receive a very low positive balance or even negative value, leading to unauthorized accumulation of tokens and potential loss of funds for the original holder.",
