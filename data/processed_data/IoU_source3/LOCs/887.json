            "vulnerabilityReason": "The arithmetic operation in the line `uint256 power = block.timestamp - stakeTime;` can lead to an integer underflow if `stakeTime` is greater than `block.timestamp`. This would cause `power` to result in a very large value, potentially leading to unintended staking power outcomes.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could manipulate the `stakeTime` parameter to produce a value greater than `block.timestamp`, resulting in excessive staking power. This can allow them to gain unauthorized rewards or influence system behaviors incorrectly due to inflated staking calculations.",
            "fixedCode": "require(stakeTime <= block.timestamp, 'Invalid stake time: stakeTime must be less than or equal to current block time.');\nuint256 power = block.timestamp - stakeTime; // Safeguard added to validate stakeTime."
