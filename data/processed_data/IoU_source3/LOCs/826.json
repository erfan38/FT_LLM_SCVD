            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function calculates the product of numbers from 1 to 33 using a uint32 variable for `product`. The value of 33 factorial exceeds the maximum limit of uint32 (4,294,967,295). In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, this overflow would occur without any warning, leading to an incorrect result. In 0.8.0 and later, the transaction reverts on overflow, impacting user experience by causing potential denial of service.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability can lead to a variety of issues, including incorrect calculations that could affect the contract's logic, potential denial of service if transactions revert, and overall unexpected behavior, which can confuse users and lead to loss of trust in the contract.",
