            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function 'sub_underflow' performs subtraction on unsigned integers without checking whether 'x' is greater than or equal to 'y'. If 'y' is greater than 'x', this operation will cause an underflow, which results in 'x - y' wrapping around to a large positive number in Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0 or reverting in version 0.8.0 and above.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If an attacker can control the input parameters and provide a larger 'y' than 'x', this can lead to inconsistencies in calculations, resulting in unexpected behavior. This could potentially be exploited to deny services or manipulate states within the contract.",
