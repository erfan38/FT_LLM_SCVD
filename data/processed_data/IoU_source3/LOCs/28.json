            "vulnerabilityReason": "The require statement is intended to prevent an overflow by checking if the new balance after adding _value is greater than the current balance of _to. However, this check can still be bypassed if the contract is deployed on versions of Solidity prior to 0.8.0, where integer overflow behavior is not automatically reverted. As a result, this check may not provide sufficient protection against overflow in older versions.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If an attacker sends a very high value of _value while _to already has a near-maximum balance, it can lead to an overflow if this contract runs on an older version of Solidity. This might result in incorrect balances and unauthorized token transfers, allowing the attacker to potentially gain tokens without holding them.",
            "fixedCode": "// The check itself is valid, but should explicitly involve safe-max calculations:\n// Not necessary in Solidity 0.8.0 and above due to automatic overflow checking.\n// If using earlier versions, consider using SafeMath library to ensure overflow checks."

If balanceOf[target] already has a value close to the maximum allowable uint256 value, this addition could overflow, potentially resulting in a wrap-around effect that gives a smaller-than-expected value.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An overflow could result in minting funds incorrectly, giving the target wallet less balance than intended and corrupting the total supply. This could lead to unintended behaviors, such as enabling unauthorized transfers of a non-existent balance.",
            "fixedCode": "// Protect against overflow by adding a check before incrementing:\nrequire(balanceOf[target] + mintedAmount >= balanceOf[target], \"Balance overflow detected\");\nbalanceOf[target] += mintedAmount; // Ensure this is done post Solidity 0.8.0 for correct behavior."

            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "Like balanceOf, the totalSupply variable is incremented by mintedAmount without any checks for overflow. If totalSupply approaches the maximum value of uint256, this increment may cause an overflow during execution, resulting in unexpected values for totalSupply.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An overflow could lead to a misleading total supply amount, as it could reset to a lower number than expected. This would corrupt the accounting of the token total supply, leading to major inconsistencies that could allow for exploitation and incorrect calculations within the contract.",
