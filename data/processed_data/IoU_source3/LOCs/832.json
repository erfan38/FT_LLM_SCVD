            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function subtracts '_amount' from 'value' without checking if this operation would result in an integer overflow or underflow. Since both 'value' and '_amount' are of type int16, which has a range from -32,768 to 32,767, a subtraction that results in a value outside this range can cause wrapping behavior that may not be intended. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, such wrapping occurs silently, allowing for unintended results in calculations and state changes.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could manipulate the '_amount' parameter in a way that causes the resulting value to overflow or underflow, leading to incorrect values being stored in 'value'. This could create vulnerabilities in the contract logic and any conditions or requirements that depend on 'value', possibly leading to justice or logic errors in the contract's behavior.",
            "fixedCode": "require((value - _amount) >= -32768 && (value - _amount) <= 32767, 'Subtraction underflow/overflow');\nvalue = value - _amount; // Ensure the result remain within int16 range before assignment."
