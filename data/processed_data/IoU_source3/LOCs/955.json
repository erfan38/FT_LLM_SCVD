            "vulnerabilityReason": "The multiplication of 'totalStaked' and '_rewardRate' in the calculateDailyRewards function is not protected against integer overflow. If '_rewardRate' is large enough, the product 'totalStaked * _rewardRate' could exceed the maximum value of uint256, causing an overflow and leading to incorrect calculations of rewards.",
