            "vulnerabilityReason": "The calculation of `durationInDays * 1 days` can overflow if `durationInDays` is set to a large enough value, exceeding the maximum limit of the uint type. This would result in an incorrect `endTime`, which could end the crowdsale earlier than intended.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If the `endTime` is incorrectly calculated due to overflow, the crowdsale might end prematurely, allowing participants to lose their opportunity to contribute. This could be exploited by malicious users and lead to a loss of trust in the platform, ultimately affecting funding and project success.",
