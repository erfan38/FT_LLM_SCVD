            "vulnerabilityReason": "The `add_overflow` function uses an unchecked block to add 1 to the maximum value of `uint256`. Since unchecked blocks bypass the overflow checks introduced in Solidity 0.8.0, this operation will overflow and wrap around to 0, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in the contract.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This overflow can result in unexpected behavior, especially if the value is used in subsequent calculations or comparisons. It can lead to vulnerabilities where the state of the contract is compromised, allowing an attacker to exploit the overflow and manipulate contract behavior.",
