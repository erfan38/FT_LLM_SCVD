            "vulnerabilityReason": "The subtraction of 1000000 from 'block.number' does not include a check to ensure that 'block.number' is greater than or equal to 1000000. If 'block.number' is less than 1000000, this operation will cause an underflow, resulting in 'rewardMultiplier' being assigned a very large number (due to uint256 wrapping). Additionally, multiplying 'baseReward' by 'rewardMultiplier' could cause an overflow if 'rewardMultiplier' is large enough.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to unintended behavior, such as calculating excessively high block rewards or incorrect rewards. This could cause significant financial implications, including the potential for excessive issuance of the token or currency based on incorrect block reward calculations, resulting in economic instability within the smart contract ecosystem.",
