            "vulnerabilityReason": "The multiplication operation between `totalShares` and `_profitPercentage` can lead to integer overflow if `_profitPercentage` is a sufficiently large number. Since both are of type uint256, exceeding the maximum value can wrap around to zero or a lower number, leading to inaccurate calculations.",
