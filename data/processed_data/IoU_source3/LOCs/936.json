            "vulnerabilityReason": "The 'mint' function directly increments 'totalSupply' by 'MINT_AMOUNT' without checking for overflow. If the current 'totalSupply' is close to the maximum value of uint256, adding 'MINT_AMOUNT' could cause an overflow, wrapping around to a lower value.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability can lead to an incorrect calculation of the total supply, undermining the token's economic model, allowing for unexpected behavior in token supply tracking, and potentially leading to issues such as unauthorized minting beyond intended limits.",
            "fixedCode": "require(totalSupply + MINT_AMOUNT <= type(uint256).max, 'Overflow detected');\ntotalSupply += MINT_AMOUNT; // Safe addition with overflow check."
