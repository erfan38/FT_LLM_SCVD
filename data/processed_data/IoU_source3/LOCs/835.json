            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function performs an arithmetic operation that adds each element from the '_values' array to 'sum' without any checks for overflow. If the cumulative sum exceeds the maximum limit of uint256, it will wrap around, leading to an incorrect and potentially dangerous state. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, this overflow would happen silently, while in newer versions it would revert the transaction, but the lack of handling for such a scenario is still a vulnerability.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending values that would intentionally cause an overflow, resulting in an incorrect total sum. This could lead to erroneous behavior in the contract where funds might be distributed incorrectly or other calculations based on 'sum' might fail.",
            "fixedCode": "for (uint i = 0; i < _values.length; i++) { require(sum + _values[i] >= sum, \"Overflow detected\"); sum += _values[i]; } // This ensures that the addition does not overflow."
