            "vulnerabilityReason": "If 'miningStart' is set to a future timestamp relative to 'block.timestamp', the result of the subtraction will be negative in an unsigned integer context, which leads to underflow. Consequently, the value of 'reward' could become a very large number, potentially creating an unfairly high reward value.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could set 'miningStart' to a future timestamp, thus manipulating the reward calculation to produce arbitrarily high rewards. This could lead to a situation where users receive excessive rewards without meeting actual mining criteria, undermining the fairness and integrity of the liquidity mining program.",
