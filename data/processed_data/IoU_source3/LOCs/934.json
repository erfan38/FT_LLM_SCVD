            "vulnerabilityReason": "In the `updateReward` function, the multiplication of `rewardRate` by `(block.timestamp - lastUpdateTime)` can cause an overflow if either value is large, especially `rewardRate`. Furthermore, adding this potentially large result to `rewardPerTokenStored` without prior checks can lead to another overflow, creating incorrect total reward calculations.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "The overflow could result in calculating incorrect rewards for users, potentially allowing them to receive rewards that are much larger than intended or none at all. This behavior can lead to significant financial discrepancies and loss, undermining trust in the contract.",
