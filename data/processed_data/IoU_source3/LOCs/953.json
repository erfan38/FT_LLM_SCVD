                "rewardsPerEpoch[currentEpoch] = totalRewards * _percentage / 100;"
            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The multiplication operation 'totalRewards * _percentage' does not include checks for overflow. If '_percentage' is sufficiently large (specifically greater than 100), the result of the multiplication can exceed the maximum value representable by a uint256, leading to incorrect calculations of rewards.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An integer overflow could lead to far fewer rewards being allocated than expected, or in cases of a wrap-around, it could falsely indicate an extraordinarily large reward. This maldistribution can result in potential financial losses or abuse of the reward distribution functionality.",
            "fixedCode": "uint256 calculatedRewards = (totalRewards * _percentage) / 100; require(calculatedRewards >= totalRewards, 'Overflow detected'); rewardsPerEpoch[currentEpoch] = calculatedRewards; // Perform safe arithmetic using checks or a library."
