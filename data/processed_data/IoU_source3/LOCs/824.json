            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract uses a uint8 variable to store the sum of an array of uint8 numbers. If the total of the numbers exceeds 255, it will cause an overflow due to the limitations of the uint8 data type. In older versions of Solidity, this overflow would occur without any warning, leading to incorrect results. In newer versions (0.8.0 and later), the transaction will revert, but this is still a vulnerability since it results in denial of service for a legitimate transaction.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could add a series of numbers that exceed the limit of the uint8, causing an overflow. This could lead to incorrect calculations and potentially allow manipulation of the contract's state or functions that depend on the sum calculation being accurate, effectively resulting in denied service to standard operations and incorrect behavior of the contract.",
