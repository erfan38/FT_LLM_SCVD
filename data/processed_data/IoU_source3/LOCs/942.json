In Solidity before version 0.8.0, this kind of operation can lead to integer overflow, resulting in incorrect calculations of 'lockEnd'.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An overflow in the calculation of 'lockEnd' could lead to locked assets becoming accessible earlier than intended, allowing users to withdraw their assets before the lock period is actually over. Conversely, a serious overflow could also cause the calculated 'lockEnd' to be significantly delayed, resulting in a longer lock period than intended.",
