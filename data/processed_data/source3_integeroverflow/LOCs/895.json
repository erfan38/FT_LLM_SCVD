            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract performs arithmetic operations on `totalReputation` without validating for overflow or underflow. Adding `_repChange` could exceed the maximum value of uint256, leading to an overflow. Subtracting `block.number` might result in an underflow if `block.number` is greater than `totalReputation`, which will cause `totalReputation` to wrap around to a large value.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If an overflow occurs, it could result in a negative reputation score, which could allow a user to manipulate the reputation system. Underflow could lead to an excessively inflated reputation, allowing unauthorized actions based on incorrect reputation values, potentially compromising the entire reputation system.",
