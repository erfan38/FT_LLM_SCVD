            "vulnerabilityReason": "The line subtracts 'amount' from 'totalSupply' without checking if 'amount' is greater than 'totalSupply'. If 'amount' exceeds 'totalSupply', this will lead to an integer underflow in versions of Solidity prior to 0.8.0, which could result in 'totalSupply' wrapping around to a very large number (due to underflow), disrupting token economics.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This underflow risk could allow the total supply to become incorrect and potentially very large, leading to a situation where tokens can be 'burned' beyond the actual supply. This could result in significant financial and operational impacts for the token's economic model, including unauthorized transfers and manipulation.",
