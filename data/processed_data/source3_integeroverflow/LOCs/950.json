            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The require statement checks if 'amount' is less than or equal to 'totalSupply'. However, if multiple transactions are processed concurrently, it is possible that 'totalSupply' becomes less than 'amount' after the check but before the subtraction happens. This can cause 'totalSupply' to underflow, possibly resulting in an unintended increase in total supply instead of the intended decrease.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "The underflow could lead to the total supply of tokens becoming larger than intended, allowing for the possibility of unauthorized token creation. This can lead to inflation of the token supply, which undermines trust in the token's economy and can result in financial losses for holders of the token.",
            "fixedCode": "require(amount <= totalSupply, \"Amount exceeds total supply.\");\ntotalSupply = totalSupply - amount; // Consider using SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+ which prevents underflow."
