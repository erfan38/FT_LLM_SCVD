            "vulnerabilityReason": "The assignment of the total supply to a large literal value (2000000000) does not contain any checks or input validation, which could lead to issues in the future if the contract were to implement arithmetic operations without the use of SafeMath or similar libraries. Given that the contract does not utilize Solidity 0.8.x's built-in overflow checks, this practice reflects a lack of defensive programming practices. While this specific line is unlikely to lead to an overflow directly, it indicates that similar assignments or operations may occur elsewhere in the contract without proper safety measures, potentially creating vulnerabilities to overflow or underflow.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If addition or subtraction involving `totalSupply` or similar uint state variables were to occur without proper checks, it could lead to unintended behaviors, like incorrectly setting `totalSupply` to a negative value through underflow, or accumulating too large a value through overflow, inadvertently allowing minting of unforeseen amounts of tokens.",
