            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract does not check for integer overflow when adding `_mintAmount` to `totalSupply`, potentially exceeding the maximum value of uint256. Subtracting `block.number` from `totalSupply` can also lead to underflow if `block.number` is greater than `totalSupply`.",
