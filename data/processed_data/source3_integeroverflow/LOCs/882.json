            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract performs a subtraction operation between `block.timestamp` and `stakeTime`. If `stakeTime` is greater than `block.timestamp`, this will result in an integer underflow, leading to an incorrectly calculated `unlocked` value that could be excessively high.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability can compromise the stake unlocking mechanism, allowing users to unlock more than they should. It could facilitate unauthorized withdrawals, potentially leading to financial loss for the contract's users.",
