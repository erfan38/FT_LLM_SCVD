            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract performs a subtraction operation on `balances[msg.sender]`, which could lead to an integer underflow if `amount` is greater than `balances[msg.sender]`. If the `require` condition is not met due to an oversight, the balance could become a very large number instead of the expected smaller number (as due to Solidity's treatment of unsigned integers).",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by calling the `withdraw` function with an `amount` larger than their balance. This would allow manipulation of the user's balance to an unintended large value, potentially leading to unauthorized withdrawals and loss of funds.",
            "fixedCode": "require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, \"Insufficient balance\");  // Ensure balance is sufficient\nbalances[msg.sender] -= amount;"
