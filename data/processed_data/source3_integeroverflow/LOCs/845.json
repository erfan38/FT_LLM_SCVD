            "vulnerabilityReason": "The 'multiply' function attempts to multiply two uint8 values without checking if the result would exceed the maximum value for uint8 (255). If the product of a and b exceeds 255, it will wrap around due to overflow, leading to incorrect results.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this by passing two values that, when multiplied, result in an overflow. For instance, multiplying 16 and 16 would yield 256, causing the result to wrap to 0, which could lead to unintended behavior or vulnerabilities in subsequent logic that depends on the result of this multiplication.",
