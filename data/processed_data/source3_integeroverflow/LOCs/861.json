            "vulnerabilityReason": "The `castVote` function performs an arithmetic addition on `totalVotes` without any checks for overflow. If the `votes` variable contains a sufficiently large value such that when added to `totalVotes` exceeds the maximum value for a uint (2^256 - 1), it will result in an overflow, causing `totalVotes` to wrap around to a lower value.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this overflow by passing a large value for `votes`, allowing them to bypass the expected total number of votes, leading to incorrect voting results or unexpected contract behavior.",
            "fixedCode": "require(totalVotes + votes >= totalVotes, \"Overflow detected\");\ntotalVotes = totalVotes + votes;"
