            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function `sumArray` adds elements from the input array `numbers` into the variable `sum`, which is of type `uint8`. This type can only hold values from 0 to 255. If the cumulative total of the elements in the array exceeds 255, an overflow will occur, resulting in the value wrapping around to a smaller number. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, this would happen silently without any error, while versions 0.8.0 and later would revert the transaction, making it a serious oversight in error handling.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If the function `sumArray` is called with an array containing enough elements that their total exceeds 255, the result would incorrectly reflect a smaller number due to overflow. This could lead to logical errors, incorrect calculations, and unintended consequences in the contract's functionality, potentially impacting the flow of funds or assets within the contract.",
