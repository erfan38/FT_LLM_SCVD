            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract performs arithmetic operations with `totalLiquidity` without checks for overflow or underflow. Adding `_amount` to `totalLiquidity` can lead to an overflow if the new value exceeds the maximum value of uint256. Additionally, subtracting `block.number` from `totalLiquidity` can cause an underflow if `block.number` is greater than `totalLiquidity`.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "These vulnerabilities can lead to incorrect liquidity calculations, allowing malicious actors to manipulate the liquidity state, potentially leading to loss of funds or denial of service within the contract. An attacker could exploit this by artificially inflating the total liquidity or corrupting the contract state, disrupting its intended operations.",
