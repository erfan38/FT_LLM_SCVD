This is a typical integer overflow vulnerability in contracts using unsigned integers.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This overflow could potentially lead to logic errors or unexpected behavior in the contract where the count value may need to represent a valid state. Consequently, it could allow a user to increment the count indefinitely, leading to unintended behavior or security issues.",

            "vulnerabilityReason": "In the 'decrement' function, decreasing 'count' when it is already at 0 will cause an underflow, resulting in count jumping to 255. This is a typical integer underflow vulnerability in contracts using unsigned integers.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This underflow could lead to logic errors or unintended interactions with other functions that depend on count being non-negative. A negative count could mislead contract logic or affect calculations leading to unauthorized behavior.",
