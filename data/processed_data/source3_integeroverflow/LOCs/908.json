            "vulnerabilityReason": "The code performs a subtraction operation where `block.timestamp` (the current block's timestamp) is subtracted from `auctionEndTime`. If `block.timestamp` exceeds `auctionEndTime` (which can occur after the auction ends), this will result in an integer underflow, yielding a very large number because of how unsigned integers are handled in Solidity.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Exploiting this underflow could lead to incorrect calculations for the time left in the auction. It may allow an attacker to see a misleadingly large amount of time remaining in the auction, which could disrupt auction logic and user expectations. This misrepresentation could lead to unauthorized behavior, such as extending an auction incorrectly.",
