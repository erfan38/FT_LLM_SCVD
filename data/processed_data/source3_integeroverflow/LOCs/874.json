            "vulnerabilityReason": "The code subtracts 'startTime' from 'block.timestamp' without checking if 'startTime' is greater than 'block.timestamp'. If 'startTime' is more recent than the current block time, this subtraction will result in an unexpected large value due to underflow, potentially leading to erroneous reward calculations.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This underflow could cause the contract to return a negative value (interpreted as a very large uint256 value), which might accidentally grant the caller an excessively high reward beyond the intended limits. This could lead to exploit scenarios where users manipulate their start times and receive more rewards than allowed.",
