            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract performs an increment operation on a uint8 variable 'count' without any checks for overflow. Since uint8 has a maximum value of 255, adding 1 to it will cause it to overflow and reset to 0, which leads to unexpected behavior.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this by calling the increment function when 'count' is 255, leading to incorrect state and logic in the contract, as the count will reset to 0 instead of exceeding 255.",
