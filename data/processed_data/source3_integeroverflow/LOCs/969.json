If both values are large enough, their product could exceed the maximum value for uint, triggering an overflow condition and leading to incorrect calculations of the refund amount.",

This may cause users to receive much less than intended, or potentially allow excessive refunds if the calculation fails in unexpected ways, leading to financial losses for the contract owner.",
