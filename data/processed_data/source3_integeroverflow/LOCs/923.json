            "vulnerabilityReason": "The 'highestBid' is computed by adding 'bidAmount' without any checks for overflow. If 'highestBid' is close to the maximum value of uint256 and a sufficiently large 'bidAmount' is added, it will cause an overflow, resulting in an incorrect highest bid value.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability can lead to an incorrect state of the auction, allowing bids that should be invalid to be considered valid. An attacker could exploit this by placing a very high bid that wraps around and appears as a low valid bid, disrupting the auction mechanism.",
            "fixedCode": "highestBid = highestBid + bidAmount; require(highestBid >= bidAmount, 'Overflow detected, invalid bid amount.'); // Alternatively, use Solidity 0.8+ which has built-in overflow checking."
