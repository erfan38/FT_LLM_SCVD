            "vulnerabilityReason": "In the 'getVestedAmount' function, the code subtracts 'vestingStart' from 'block.timestamp'. If 'block.timestamp' is less than 'vestingStart', this will result in an underflow, yielding an incorrect negative value for 'vestingPeriod'. Additionally, multiplying 'vestingPeriod' by 10 could lead to an overflow if 'vestingPeriod' is a very large number after a successful underflow, resulting in further incorrect calculations.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If an attacker or a user calls 'getVestedAmount' before 'vestingStart', they could exploit this underflow to receive inappropriate amounts of tokens or manipulate the vesting calculations, leading to potential loss of funds or incorrect token distribution.",
