            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function attempts to add 1 to the maximum value of a uint256, which is 2^256 - 1. This operation will result in an overflow, where the value wraps around to 0. In pre-0.8.0 versions of Solidity, such behavior happens silently, which can lead to severe issues including loss of funds or incorrect contract state.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability can cause unexpected behavior in the contract. Specifically, calling this function could reset the value to 0, leading to potential denial of service and allowing for exploitation in larger contract logic that relies on the value being correct. It can also affect the reliability of transactions reliant on the outcome of this operation.",
            "fixedCode": "// Use the following validation check to prevent overflow:\nfunction add_safe() returns (uint256 _safe) {\n    uint256 max = 2**256 - 1;\n    require(max < type(uint256).max); // Should always be true\n    return max + 1; // Causes revert in Solidity 0.8.0+, or still prevents overflow in earlier versions."
