            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract increments 'loopCount' without checking if the increment would cause an overflow. Since 'loopCount' is a uint8, it can hold values only from 0 to 255. Incrementing it beyond 255 will cause it to wrap around without any errors in versions prior to Solidity 0.8.0, leading to unintended behavior.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If 'loopCount' exceeds 255, it will wrap around to 0, potentially allowing unauthorized actions or causing logic errors in smart contract operations that rely on the value of 'loopCount'. This can lead to exploits, including failure to meet the intended functionality of the contract.",
            "fixedCode": "require(loopCount + _times <= 255, \"Loop count will overflow\");\nloopCount += _times; // Instead of incrementing in a loop, add _times directly."
