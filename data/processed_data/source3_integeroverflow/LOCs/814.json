            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function attempts to subtract 200 from 100 using uint16 variables. Since uint16 cannot represent negative values, this subtraction will result in underflow, wrapping around to a large positive value in versions prior to 0.8.0 or causing a revert in versions 0.8.0 and later.",
