If 'stakingStart' is greater than 'block.timestamp', this would lead to an integer underflow, resulting in a very large number in the 'reward' variable instead of a valid positive value.",

If users exploit this situation, they could potentially claim far more rewards than intended, leading to financial losses for the contract and its users.",
