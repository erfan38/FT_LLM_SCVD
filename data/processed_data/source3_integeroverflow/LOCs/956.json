            "vulnerabilityReason": "The multiplication of 'totalLiquidity' and '_rewardPercentage' can result in an integer overflow if '_rewardPercentage' is sufficiently large. Solidity does not check for overflow or underflow in arithmetic operations in versions prior to 0.8.0, which could result in unexpected values being assigned to 'rewardsPerBlock[currentBlock].'",

If overflow occurs, it may result in either a significantly larger or smaller reward being distributed, ultimately impacting the contract's functionality and trustworthiness.",
