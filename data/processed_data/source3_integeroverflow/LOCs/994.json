            "vulnerabilityReason": "The multiplication `stakedAmount[user] * rewardRate` can cause an integer overflow if both `stakedAmount[user]` and `rewardRate` are sufficiently large. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, there are no built-in checks for overflow during arithmetic operations, meaning this calculation could exceed the maximum value of a uint, resulting in incorrect rewards being calculated, potentially much smaller than intended.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker or participant could stake a large amount of tokens and set a high reward rate, which could trigger an overflow, leading to significantly reduced rewards. This could lead to user dissatisfaction, loss of trust in the contract, and potential financial loss for stakeholders due to unexpected reward calculations.",
            "fixedCode": "require(stakedAmount[user] <= type(uint).max / rewardRate, \"Calculation would cause overflow\");\nreturn stakedAmount[user] * rewardRate / 100; // This ensures the multiplication does not overflow."
