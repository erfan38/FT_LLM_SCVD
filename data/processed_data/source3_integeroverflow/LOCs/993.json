            "vulnerabilityReason": "The calculation of `totalCost` involves multiplying `itemPrices[itemId]` by `quantity`. If both values are large enough, this multiplication can exceed the maximum value for a uint, causing an overflow. The result of an overflow is that `totalCost` could be a smaller than expected value, which can lead to incorrect payment validation.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this overflow vulnerability by setting values for `itemPrices[itemId]` and `quantity` such that their product results in a totalCost that is significantly lower than the actual price. This might allow them to purchase items for a much lower price than intended, resulting in financial loss for the contract owner.",
