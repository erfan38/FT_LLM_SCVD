            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function performs a multiplication operation (_blockNumber * 100) followed by an addition with _baseReward. In Solidity, if _blockNumber is large enough, the multiplication could overflow the maximum value of uint, leading to incorrect calculations of the reward amount and thus, potential loss of funds.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This overflow could result in underestimating the reward amount, causing miners or validators to receive significantly less compensation than intended. Such a vulnerability could discourage participation in the network or lead to an uneven distribution of rewards.",
            "fixedCode": "// To avoid overflow, we can use Solidity 0.8's built-in overflow checks or manually check the limits:\nrequire(_blockNumber <= type(uint).max / 100, \"Block number too high to calculate reward safely.\");\nuint reward = _baseReward + (_blockNumber * 100); // This will now be safe."
