            "vulnerabilityReason": "The addition operation 'lockTime + lockDuration' does not include checks for overflow. If 'lockTime' is set near the maximum value of uint256, the result of the addition can exceed the maximum limit, causing it to wrap around and resulting in an incorrect unlock time.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability may lead to the unlock time being calculated incorrectly, allowing users to access their locked assets much earlier than intended. This could facilitate unauthorized access to funds and undermine the purpose of the timelock feature.",
