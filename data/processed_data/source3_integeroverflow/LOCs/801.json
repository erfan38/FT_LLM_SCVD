            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability could be exploited to prevent the execution of functions reliant on this 'divide' operation, resulting in a denial of service. Furthermore, since 'value' is of type uint8, it limits the range of possible values, which may lead to truncation when performing the division.",
