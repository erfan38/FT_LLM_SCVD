            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract performs arithmetic operations on the 'balances' mapping without checks for overflow or underflow. The subtraction operation can lead to an underflow if the balance is less than 'amount', causing 'balances[msg.sender]' to wrap around to a very high value (since it's using uint64). Similarly, adding 'amount' to 'balances[to]' can lead to overflow if the resulting sum exceeds the maximum uint64 value of 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "These vulnerabilities may allow users to transfer more tokens than they own, resulting in potentially unauthorized or invalid transactions. Attackers could exploit this to create tokens out of thin air, leading to financial losses and manipulation of the token economy.",
