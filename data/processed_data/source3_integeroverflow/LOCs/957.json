            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The calculation involves multiplying 'totalTokens' by '_releasePercentage'. If '_releasePercentage' is a large value, the multiplication can result in an integer overflow. This occurs because Solidity does not automatically handle overflow and underflow checks in versions prior to 0.8.0, potentially leading to incorrect values being stored in 'tokensReleasedPerMonth'.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An overflow could lead to the calculation yielding a negative or incorrect number of tokens released, thus affecting the vesting schedule by either releasing too many or too few tokens to beneficiaries, which could result in financial losses or undermine the intended distribution mechanics.",
            "fixedCode": "require(_releasePercentage <= 100, \"Release percentage must be <= 100\");\nuint256 releaseAmount = totalTokens * _releasePercentage / 100;\ntokensReleasedPerMonth[currentMonth] = releaseAmount;\n// Alternatively, use SafeMath library for ensuring safe arithmetic operations."
