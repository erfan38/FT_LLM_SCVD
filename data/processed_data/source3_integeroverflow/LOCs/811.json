            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function attempts to add 1 to the maximum value stored in a uint8 (255). In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, this addition would cause an overflow, wrapping the value back to 0 without any warnings. Even in versions 0.8.0 and later, while the operation would revert the transaction, the vulnerability still exists as there is a risk of denial of service when unexpected overflows occur.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability could lead to unexpected behavior where calculations that depend on the result of `add_overflow` could mistakenly receive a value of 0 instead of 256, leading to incorrect logic execution or state in the smart contract, which might allow attackers to exploit the contract, causing unintended fund transfers or logic errors.",
            "fixedCode": "uint8 max = 255; require(max < 255, \"Overflow detected\"); return max + 1; // Using a require statement to safeguard against overflow."
