            "vulnerabilityReason": "The addition of `lockTime` and `lockDuration` is susceptible to integer overflow. If their sum exceeds the maximum value of uint256, the result wraps around to zero, which can lead to the incorrect unlock time being calculated.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability could allow locked assets to be accessed earlier than intended, as the calculated unlock time may erroneously appear to be in the past once the overflow occurs, compromising the intended security of the time-lock mechanism.",
