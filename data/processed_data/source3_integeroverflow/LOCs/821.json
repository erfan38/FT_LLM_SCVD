            "vulnerabilityReason": "The subtraction operation on the uint8 variable 'result' does not check for underflow. When 'result' reaches 0, subtracting 1 will cause it to wrap around to 255, which is unexpected behavior in the context of the logic that the function appears to implement.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "The underflow could lead to unexpected results by allowing the function to return a value that is not a logical outcome of its calculations. In addition, if this function is relied upon by other contract logic, it could lead to vulnerabilities such as incorrect states or denial of service.",
            "fixedCode": "if (result > 0) { result -= 1; } // Safeguarding against underflow. Alternatively, using built-in SafeMath during older Solidity versions."
