            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract sends Ether to `msg.sender` using `call.value(_am)()` before updating the user's balance with `balances[msg.sender] -= _am`. This allows a malicious contract to re-enter the `CashOut` function and call `CashOut` again before the state is updated, potentially extracting more Ether than its balance allows.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can deploy a malicious contract that calls `CashOut`, receives Ether, and then re-enters `CashOut` before the balance is deducted, draining funds from the contract by exploiting the unchanged balance.",
