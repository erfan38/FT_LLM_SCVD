            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract sends Ether to `msg.sender` using `call.value(_am)()` without updating the account's balance first. This allows a malicious contract to re-enter the `Collect` function before the balance is updated, potentially allowing the attacker to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can exploit this by deploying a malicious contract that takes control of the fallback function, which can re-enter the `Collect` function before the balance is decremented, allowing for multiple withdrawals of the same amount, thus draining the funds from the contract.",
