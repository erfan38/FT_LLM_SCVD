This creates a reentrancy vulnerability because if `msg.sender` is a contract that calls back into the `withdraw` function before the balance is updated, it can withdraw the same amount again before the state change occurs.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to drain the contract's Ether by repeatedly calling the `withdraw` function before the balance is decremented, allowing them to withdraw more funds than they actually have in their account.",
