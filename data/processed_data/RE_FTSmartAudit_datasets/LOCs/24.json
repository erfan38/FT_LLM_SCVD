            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract performs an external call to `msg.sender` using `call.value(_am)()`, which allows for reentrancy. This means that if `msg.sender` is a contract, it can call back into the `Collect` function before the balance is updated, enabling a malicious contract to drain Ether.",
