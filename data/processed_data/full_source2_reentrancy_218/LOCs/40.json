            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function uses `call.value(balances[msg.sender])()` to transfer Ether to the caller before the user's balance is set to zero. This allows a malicious contract to re-enter the `withdraw` function before the balance is updated, potentially leading to multiple withdrawals in a single transaction.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could deploy a malicious contract that calls back into the `withdraw` function after receiving Ether, allowing them to repeatedly withdraw funds until the contract is drained.",
