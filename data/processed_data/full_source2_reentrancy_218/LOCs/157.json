If `msg.sender` is a contract, it could lead to reentrancy where the malicious contract re-enters the `withdraw` function and withdraws more funds than intended before the actual balance is updated.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could create a malicious contract that calls the `withdraw` function repeatedly, draining funds from the contract balance before the internal state reflects the actual balance after the first withdrawal.",
