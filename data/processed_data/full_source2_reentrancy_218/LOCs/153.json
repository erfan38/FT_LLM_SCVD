            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract uses `call.value(userBalances[msg.sender])()` to send Ether to `msg.sender` without updating the state (userBalances) before the external call. This allows a malicious contract to re-enter the `withdrawBalance` function before the user's balance is set to 0, enabling the attacker to withdraw more ether than they are entitled to.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could deploy a malicious contract as `msg.sender`, which re-enters the `withdrawBalance` function before the user's balance is updated. This could lead to multiple Ether withdrawals, draining the contract's balance.",
            "fixedCode": "userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;  // Update user balance before external call\n(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(userBalances[msg.sender])();  // Perform the external call after state update\nrequire(success, \"Transfer failed\");  // Ensure the transfer was successful"
