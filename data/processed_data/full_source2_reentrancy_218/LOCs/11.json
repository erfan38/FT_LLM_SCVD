            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract uses `call.value(amountRaised)()`, allowing the receiving contract (`msg.sender`) to execute arbitrary code before the state is updated. This opens the door for reentrancy attacks, where a malicious contract can call back into `finishDistribution` before `balances[msg.sender]` is updated, enabling it to repeatedly withdraw funds.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious contract that triggers a reentrancy. By calling `finishDistribution` multiple times before the balance is decreased, the attacker could drain the contract's funds entirely, bypassing the intended checks and balances.",
