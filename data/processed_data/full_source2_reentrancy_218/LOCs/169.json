            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract uses 'call.value(amount)()' to send Ether to the caller before the state is updated. This allows an external contract to execute code during the transfer, potentially re-entering the 'withdraw' function before the balance deduction occurs.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "A malicious contract could exploit this vulnerability to re-enter the 'withdraw' function multiple times before the balance is updated, allowing it to drain more Ether than it is entitled to, thus exploiting the contract's funds.",
