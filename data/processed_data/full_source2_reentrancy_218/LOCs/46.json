            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of `call.value(_amount)()` means that the external contract can execute code upon receiving Ether before ensuring that the current contract state is updated. This permits a malicious contract to re-enter the `mintETHRewards` function repeatedly, draining funds before the balance is updated.",
