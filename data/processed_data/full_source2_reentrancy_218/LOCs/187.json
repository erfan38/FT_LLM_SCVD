            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function uses `call.value(_am)()` to send Ether to `msg.sender` before updating the state of the contract. This allows for a reentrancy attack because a malicious contract could execute its fallback function and call `CashOut` again before the balance is deducted, potentially allowing the malicious contract to withdraw more Ether than it is entitled to.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious contract that calls `CashOut` multiple times in one transaction, effectively draining the contract's balance because the balance state is only updated after the Ether is sent.",
            "fixedCode": "if(_am <= balances[msg.sender]) {\n    balances[msg.sender] -= _am;  // Update the state first\n    if(!msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) {\n        revert(); // Handle transfer failure\n    }\n}"
