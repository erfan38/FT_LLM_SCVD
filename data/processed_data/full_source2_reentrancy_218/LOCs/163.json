            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`, which allows external calls to execute arbitrary code before updating the contract's state. If the recipient is a contract, it can call back into `CashOut` before the balance is updated, leading to potential multiple withdrawals and reentrancy attacks.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "A malicious contract could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `CashOut` function before the balance of the user (`msg.sender`) is decremented. This can drain the bank's balance and allow the attacker to withdraw more funds than they should.",
