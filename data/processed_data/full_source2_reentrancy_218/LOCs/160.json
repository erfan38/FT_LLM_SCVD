            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of `_recipient.call.value(balances[msg.sender])()` allows the recipient to execute arbitrary code, potentially calling back into `withdraw` before the state is updated. If an attacker creates a malicious contract that receives the Ether, they can re-enter the `withdraw` function and withdraw funds repeatedly before the `balances[msg.sender]` is set to zero.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "The reentrancy vulnerability could allow a malicious actor to call the `withdraw` function multiple times in a single transaction, draining the contract's balance without the state being updated first.",
