            "vulnerabilityReason": "The method 'call.value(_am)()' allows an external contract to execute arbitrary code before the state is updated. This permits reentrancy, as the recipient contract could call back into 'CashOut' before the balance is decremented, allowing it to withdraw funds multiple times.",
