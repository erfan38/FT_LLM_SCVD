       This mitigates a particular class of potential attack on the Wyvern DAO (which owns this registry) - if at any point the value of assets held by proxy contracts exceeded the value of half the WYV supply (votes in the DAO),
       a malicious but rational attacker could buy half the Wyvern and grant themselves access to all the proxy contracts. A delay period renders this attack nonthreatening - given two weeks, if that happened, users would have
       plenty of time to notice and transfer their assets.
