            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract uses 'now' (an alias for block.timestamp) to enforce timing constraints and payout conditions. This dependency poses a risk as miners can influence the block timestamp within a range, potentially circumventing the 'require(now != pastBlockTime)' check and strategically manipulating the timestamp to satisfy 'now % 15 == 0', leading to unintended payouts.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit the manipulation of 'now' by maintaining a timestamp equal to 'pastBlockTime', which could allow them to repeatedly call this function and bypass the require check. Furthermore, by controlling the timestamp, they could easily make it so that 'now' is a multiple of 15, triggering the payout condition and draining the contract's funds.",
