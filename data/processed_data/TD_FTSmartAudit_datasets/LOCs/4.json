            "vulnerabilityReason": "The code uses `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale has finished. This approach is vulnerable because miners can influence the timestamp in the block they mine, allowing them to manipulate the outcome of this return statement. Specifically, if miners choose a timestamp that is just before the specified `1546300800`, they can prevent the crowdsale from being marked as finished, enabling them to exploit the system.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "A malicious miner could manipulate the timestamp to remain below `1546300800` to continue participating in the crowdsale or enable additional sales after the intended end time, compromising the integrity of the crowdsale and allowing manipulative actions for personal benefit.",
            "fixedCode": "return block.timestamp >= (1546300800 - TIME_TOLERANCE); // Applying a time buffer like TIME_TOLERANCE."
