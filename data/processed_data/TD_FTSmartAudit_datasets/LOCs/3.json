            "vulnerabilityReason": "The variable 'lastInvestmentTimestamp' is assigned the value of 'block.timestamp', which is subject to manipulation by miners who have some latitude in setting the block's timestamp. This reliance on block.timestamp poses a vulnerability in timing checks related to investment periods.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "A malicious miner could manipulate the block timestamp within a small range to reset their investment time or trigger timing-based funding opportunities. For instance, they could quickly invest again just before the one-minute limit, allowing them to exploit the resetInvestment() function and potentially withdraw funds before the intended cooldown period expires.",
