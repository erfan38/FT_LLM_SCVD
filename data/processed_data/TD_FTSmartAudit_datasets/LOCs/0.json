This affects the fairness of the lottery since a miner can choose a timestamp that helps them win consistently, compromising the randomness and integrity of the game.",

By doing so, the miner could repeatedly withdraw funds from the contract, leading to potential financial losses for other users and rendering the lottery mechanism ineffective and unfair.",
