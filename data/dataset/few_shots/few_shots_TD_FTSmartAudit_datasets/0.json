As a miner, they test different timestamps within an allowable range (e.g., 60 seconds) before finalizing the block, computing uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2 until random == 0. With a 50% chance per second and dozens of tries, the success probability approaches 100% (e.g., 1 - (0.5)^60). This triggers the payout in lines 37–44, allowing them to drain the pot repeatedly, bypassing the intended randomness and making the lottery unfair.",
