The function relies on 'now' (equivalent to 'block.timestamp') to determine transaction validity and winning conditions. Miners can manipulate timestamps to increase their chances of winning by ensuring 'now % 15 == 0'. This introduces a security risk in gambling or lottery-based smart contracts. A more secure approach would use entropy sources such as block difficulty, previous block hashes, and sender address to make the outcome less predictable."
