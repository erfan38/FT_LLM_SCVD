The smart contract contains an arithmetic vulnerability. The function 'transfer' subtracts '_value' from 'balances[msg.sender]' without ensuring that 'balances[msg.sender]' is greater than or equal to '_value'. Since Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0 do not have built-in overflow and underflow checks, if '_value' is greater than 'balances[msg.sender]', it will cause an underflow, wrapping around to a very large number. This would allow an attacker to transfer more tokens than they actually own, effectively granting them unlimited tokens. To mitigate this, the contract should use explicit checks for balance sufficiency and consider using Solidity 0.8+ or SafeMath."
