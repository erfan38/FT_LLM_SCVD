            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function adds each number in the input array to a running total `sum` without checking if this addition will cause an overflow. If the total of `numbers` exceeds the maximum value for `uint256`, it will wrap around to a smaller value, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, if the input array `numbers` is empty, the division by zero on line 7 will cause a runtime error when calculating the average.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This overflow vulnerability can lead to inaccurate average calculations, allowing an attacker to manipulate the inputs to receive false returns. Moreover, if the input array is empty, it can also lead to a division by zero error, which could cause the transaction to fail or behave unexpectedly.",
