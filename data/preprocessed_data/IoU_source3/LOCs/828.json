            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract performs an addition on the `balances[msg.sender]` without checking for overflow. If the sum of the current balance and `_amount` exceeds the maximum value of `uint256`, it will overflow and wrap around, resulting in a smaller balance than intended. This scenario can lead to significant vulnerabilities, particularly with funds being manipulated unintentionally.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to deposit an excessive amount of tokens by surpassing the `uint256` limit, causing their balance to misrepresent their actual holdings. Ultimately, this could allow unauthorized access to funds or enable attacks such as draining the contract of its intended resources.",
            "fixedCode": "require(balances[msg.sender] + _amount >= balances[msg.sender], \"Overflow detected\");\nbalances[msg.sender] += _amount; // Using Solidity 0.8+ built-in checks or require statements in earlier versions to validate addition."
