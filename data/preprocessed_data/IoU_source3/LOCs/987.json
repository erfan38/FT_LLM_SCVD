Since uint8 can hold a maximum value of 255, adding any value to an already full balance will cause it to overflow and wrap around, resulting in a smaller balance than expected.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this by depositing amounts that, when summed with the current balance, exceed 255, causing the resulting balance to wrap around to a lower value. This may lead to unintended behaviors in the contract where the account appears to have a smaller balance, allowing them to deposit more or even withdraw funds they shouldn't be able to.",
