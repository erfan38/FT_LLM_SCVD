            "vulnerabilityReason": "The code performs an addition operation between `block.timestamp` and `LOCK_DURATION` without checking for overflow. If `LOCK_DURATION` is added to a very high `block.timestamp` that is near the maximum value of uint256, it could result in an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect value for `lockTime`. This would cause the lock duration to be miscalculated, potentially allowing locked assets to be accessed sooner than intended.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could manipulate the situation such that their assets could be unlocked prematurely, leading to potential theft or unauthorized access to funds that should be locked for a specified duration.",
