            "vulnerabilityReason": "The calculations for the future timestamp involve multiplications with `_days` and `_hours`, which can lead to integer overflow if either of these inputs are large enough. Specifically, multiplying these values by large constants can exceed the maximum value of a uint256, resulting in wraparound and incorrect future timestamp calculations.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An overflow in the timestamp calculation could lead to erroneous contract behavior, particularly if time-based functionality relies on accurate future timestamps. This can result in incorrect states in the contract, leading to unintended outcomes such as premature or delayed executions of time-related conditions.",
