            "vulnerabilityReason": "The addition operation `lockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease` does not check for overflow, which could occur if the resulting value exceeds the maximum uint256 value. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, this could lead to the lock time wrapping around to a very small value, potentially bypassing the intended time lock mechanism.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this by manipulating the input to `_secondsToIncrease`, causing an overflow and effectively reducing their lock time to a minimal value. This could enable them to access their funds earlier than intended, undermining the purpose of the lock time feature.",
            "fixedCode": "require(lockTime[msg.sender] + _secondsToIncrease > lockTime[msg.sender], \"Overflow detected\");\nlockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease; // Adding a check before the addition to ensure no overflow occurs."
