            "vulnerabilityReason": "The 'subtract' function performs a subtraction operation on 'value' without checking if 'amount' is greater than 'value'. If 'amount' exceeds 'value', it will cause an underflow, resulting in an incorrect value due to uint8's limited range, effectively wrapping around to a high value.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this underflow by providing an appropriately large 'amount', causing 'value' to wrap around and potentially giving them the ability to manipulate the 'value' in unintended ways, such as increasing it when trying to decrease it, leading to unauthorized increases in the state of the contract.",
            "fixedCode": "require(amount <= value, \"Amount exceeds current value\");\nvalue -= amount; // This ensures that the subtraction does not cause an underflow."
