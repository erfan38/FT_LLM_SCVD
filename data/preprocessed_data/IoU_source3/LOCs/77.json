            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract initializes the totalSupply to a large value (1 billion) without any checks for overflow. If the totalSupply variable were to increment further in the future, it could lead to an overflow, wrapping around to zero, which would result in incorrect balance calculations and unstable contract behavior.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If an attacker finds a way to trigger further increments to totalSupply or manipulate it, it could allow them to exploit the contracts' financial logic, potentially leading to loss of funds or unauthorized token generation as balances may become inconsistent with the actual values.",
