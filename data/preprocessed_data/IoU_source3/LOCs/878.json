            "vulnerabilityReason": "The code performs an arithmetic operation of subtraction (`block.timestamp - lockTime`) without checking if `lockTime` is greater than `block.timestamp`. If `lockTime` is indeed greater, it will result in an integer underflow, creating a negative value that wraps around to a very large unsigned integer.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This underflow could lead to incorrect logic in the contract, potentially allowing users to unlock more tokens than intended, jeopardizing the token unlocking mechanism and leading to unintended access to possibly restricted tokens.",
            "fixedCode": "require(lockTime <= block.timestamp, 'lockTime must not be in the future');\nuint256 unlocked = block.timestamp - lockTime; // Now safe, as we checked the condition."
