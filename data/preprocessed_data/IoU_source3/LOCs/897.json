            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract performs arithmetic operations on `tokenSupply` without any checks for overflow or underflow. Specifically, adding `_inflationRate` to `tokenSupply` can cause an overflow if `_inflationRate` is sufficiently large. Similarly, subtracting `block.number` from `tokenSupply` can lead to an underflow if `block.number` exceeds the current `tokenSupply`.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "These vulnerabilities can lead to incorrect calculations of the `tokenSupply`, which may compromise the tokenomics of the contract. An attacker might exploit these issues to manipulate the inflationary mechanism, potentially leading to excessive token creation or depletion of the token supply, resulting in financial loss for token holders.",
            "fixedCode": "tokenSupply = tokenSupply + _inflationRate;\nrequire(tokenSupply >= _inflationRate, 'Overflow detected');\nrequire(tokenSupply >= block.number, 'Underflow detected');\ntokenSupply = tokenSupply - block.number;"
