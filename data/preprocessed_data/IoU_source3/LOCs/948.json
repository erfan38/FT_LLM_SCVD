            "vulnerabilityReason": "The calculation 'principal * interestRate * years' involves multiple multiplications that can overflow when the values are large. In Solidity, multiplying two large uint256 values can exceed the maximum value of uint256 (2^256-1), leading to incorrect results. This can lead to incorrect interest calculations, potentially resulting in lower than expected interest or other unexpected behaviors.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An overflow might cause the contract to calculate an unrealistically low interest amount, leading to significant financial losses for users expecting a certain return on their investment. This could diminish the contract's reliability or expose it to exploitation scenarios where attackers might profit from the overflow.",
            "fixedCode": "function calculateInterest(uint256 principal, uint256 years) public view returns (uint256) {\n    uint256 calculatedInterest = (principal * interestRate * years) / 100;\n    require(calculatedInterest >= 0, \"Interest calculation overflowed\");\n    return calculatedInterest;\n} // Note: Ideally, use a safe math library or built-in overflow checks in Solidity 0.8+"
