            "vulnerabilityReason": "The line performs an arithmetic addition without checking if the result exceeds the maximum value for `uint256`, leading to a potential overflow. If `reputation[user]` is already close to the maximum `uint256` value, adding `REPUTATION_INCREASE` could result in an overflow, causing `reputation[user]` to wrap around and become a smaller value instead of increasing as intended.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this overflow vulnerability to manipulate reputation values. By strategically increasing their reputation to the maximum value and then exceeding it, they could reset their reputation to a low number, disrupting the reputation system and unfairly benefiting from it.",
