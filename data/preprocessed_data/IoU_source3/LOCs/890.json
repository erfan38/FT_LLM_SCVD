            "vulnerabilityReason": "In the 'distribute' function, adding '_amount' to 'totalRewards' does not check for overflow. If '_amount' is such that the sum exceeds the maximum uint256 value, it will wrap around to zero, causing an incorrect calculation of total rewards. Similarly, subtracting 'block.timestamp' from 'totalRewards' can cause an underflow if 'block.timestamp' is greater than 'totalRewards', leading to negative rewards, which are not valid in the context of uint256.",
