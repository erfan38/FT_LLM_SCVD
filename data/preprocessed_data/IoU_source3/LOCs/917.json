            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function calculates the difference between 'block.number' and 'stakingPeriod'. If 'stakingPeriod' is greater than 'block.number', this operation will result in an underflow, leading to a negative value which will cause erroneous calculations. Furthermore, multiplying the resulting value with 'baseReward' can lead to an overflow if the difference is large enough, exceeding the maximum value a uint256 can hold.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could manipulate the 'stakingPeriod' parameter to a value greater than 'block.number', resulting in an underflow. This could allow for an incorrectly calculated reward that might be significantly inflated, leading to unauthorized rewards, potential loss of funds, or destabilization of the rewards system.",
