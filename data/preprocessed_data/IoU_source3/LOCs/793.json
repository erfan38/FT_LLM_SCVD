            "vulnerabilityReason": "The 'total' variable is declared as a uint8, which has a maximum value of 255. The addition operation 'total += value' does not check if the result exceeds this limit. If 'value' is larger than what can be added without exceeding 255, it will cause an overflow, wrapping around to a smaller number and leading to unintended consequences.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this flaw by providing a 'value' that causes 'total' to overflow, potentially allowing them to manipulate the state of the contract in unforeseen ways, leading to incorrect calculations, states, or unauthorized access to contract functions.",
            "fixedCode": "if (total + value > 255) { revert(); } total += value; // Adding a check to ensure total does not exceed 255."
