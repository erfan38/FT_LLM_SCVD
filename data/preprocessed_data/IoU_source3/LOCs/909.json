            "vulnerabilityReason": "Subtracting `stakingPeriod` from `block.number` can lead to an underflow if `stakingPeriod` is greater than `block.number`. As a result, this will yield a negative value, and when multiplied by `rewardRate`, it could lead to incorrect reward calculations or even unintended behavior in the contract.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If `stakingPeriod` is greater than `block.number`, the calculation will underflow, potentially allowing for negative rewards or unexpected large rewards due to the multiplication with `rewardRate`. This could be exploited to manipulate reward payouts.",
