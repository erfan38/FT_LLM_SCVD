            "vulnerabilityReason": "The expression 'block.number - tokenBalance' can lead to an integer underflow if 'tokenBalance' is greater than 'block.number'. In addition, multiplying 'basePower' by this difference may cause an overflow if the resulting value exceeds the maximum value for a uint256 type.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An underflow can lead to negative results being interpreted as large positive numbers, which could contribute to incorrect calculations for voting power. This allows potential manipulation of voting outcomes based on erroneous voting power values.",
