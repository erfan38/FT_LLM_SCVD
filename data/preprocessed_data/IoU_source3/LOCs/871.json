            "vulnerabilityReason": "The code performs an addition operation on `totalBalance` without checking for overflow. Although the `require` statement checks that `amount` is not greater than `maxDeposit`, it does not prevent `totalBalance` from overflowing if a large enough `amount` is added to it. This means that if `amount`, when added to `totalBalance`, exceeds the maximum value of a uint, it wraps around to a smaller value, leading to unintended consequences.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by depositing a large amount that causes `totalBalance` to overflow, resulting in a small or negative total balance. This could allow them to manipulate the system or gain access to larger amounts than what is actually held, leading to loss of funds or unauthorized withdrawals.",
            "fixedCode": "require(totalBalance + amount >= totalBalance, 'Overflow detected');\ntotalBalance = totalBalance + amount;"
