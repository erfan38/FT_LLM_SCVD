            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An overflow could lead to a situation where the resulting 'newBalance' is less than either '_currentBalance' or '_amount'. This can cause incorrect balance calculations and potentially lead to a situation where users believe they have a larger balance than they actually do, which can be exploited in further transactions or logic of the contract.",
