                "unlockTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp + LOCK_DURATION;"
            ],
            "vulnerabilityReason": "The code adds `LOCK_DURATION` to `block.timestamp`, which is a potential source of integer overflow. If the sum of `block.timestamp` and `LOCK_DURATION` exceeds the maximum value allowed for a uint256, it will reset to zero, resulting in an incorrect calculation of unlock time.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "This vulnerability could allow an attacker to access locked assets earlier than intended, as the `unlockTime` would be set incorrectly to a time in the past or an unexpected future time, leading to unauthorized access to funds.",
            "fixedCode": "require(block.timestamp + LOCK_DURATION > block.timestamp, \"Overflow detected\");\nunlockTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp + LOCK_DURATION; // Ensuring addition does not overflow"
