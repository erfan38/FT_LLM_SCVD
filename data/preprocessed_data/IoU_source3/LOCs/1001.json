            "vulnerabilityReason": "The code performs a multiplication operation that can lead to an overflow if both `userInfo[msg.sender]._points` and `multiplier` are large enough. Since Ethereum's Solidity uses fixed-size integers and does not include automatic overflow checks prior to version 0.8.0, the multiplication may exceed the maximum limit of uint256, wrapping around to a lower value.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could set a very high amount of `_points` for a user and set an appropriate `multiplier`, resulting in an overflow during the multiplication which would yield a much smaller number than expected, allowing for unintended calculations and potentially exploiting the reward system.",
