            "vulnerabilityReason": "The calculation 'block.timestamp - lockStartTime' directly subtracts 'lockStartTime' from 'block.timestamp' without checking if 'lockStartTime' is greater than 'block.timestamp'. This can result in an integer underflow, leading to a very large value for 'stage' if 'lockStartTime' is in the future compared to the current block timestamp.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this by providing a future 'lockStartTime', causing the 'stage' variable to produce an unexpectedly large value. This could break the vesting logic, allowing users to mistakenly believe they have reached a certain stage in their vesting schedule, potentially leading to unauthorized access to funds or rewards.",
