This can allow an attacker to manipulate state variables or withdraw funds repeatedly before the state is fully updated.",

            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Similar to the previous issue, a malicious contract could exploit this call by executing recursive transactions, allowing for repeated fund withdrawals or manipulation of the state before proper event logging, risking the integrity of the contractâ€™s balance.",
