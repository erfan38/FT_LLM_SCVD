            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract uses a low-level call to transfer Ether without performing checks to ensure the transaction was successful and without updating the contract's state before making the call. This allows a malicious contract to re-enter the `executeTransaction` function before the transaction state variable `tx.executed` is updated, causing potential reentrancy attacks.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious contract that calls back into the `executeTransaction` function before the state is updated, allowing them to execute the transaction multiple times and drain funds from the wallet.",
            "fixedCode": "require(tx.value <= address(this).balance, 'Insufficient contract balance');\ntx.executed = true;\n(bool success, ) = tx.destination.call.value(tx.value)(tx.data);\nrequire(success, 'Transaction execution failed'); // Ensure the transaction was successful"
