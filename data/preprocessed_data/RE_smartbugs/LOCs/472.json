Since the state change occurs after the transfer, an attacker could exploit this to withdraw funds multiple times before the state reflects the actual funds left.",

            "vulnerabilityReason": "Using `call.value()` to send Ether allows for potential reentrancy attacks if the recipient is a contract. The execution of fallback functions can manipulate the contract's state before this call's success is processed, especially if failing sends don't revert immediately and state is updated afterwards.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If the `admin` address is an externally owned account, the risk is lower, but if it's a contract, it could lead to multiple withdrawals in the same transaction.
