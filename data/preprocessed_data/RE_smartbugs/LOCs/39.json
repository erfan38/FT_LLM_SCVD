            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of `call.value()` sends Ether to the wallet after the `weiRaised` state has been updated and tokens have been transferred. This sequence allows an attacker to execute a reentrant call before the state change is finalized, which could result in unintended behavior or multiple withdrawals before the contractâ€™s state reflects the actual changes.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by recursively calling `buyTokens`, enabling them to withdraw funds repeatedly before the contract can properly manage its balances. This could lead to financial losses for the contract and affect the intended fund distribution.",
