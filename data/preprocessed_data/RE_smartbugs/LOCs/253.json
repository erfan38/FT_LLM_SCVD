            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of `call.value()` for sending Ether to `tx.destination` before marking the transaction as executed (`tx.executed = true`) creates a reentrancy vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by creating a malicious contract that calls back into the MultiSigWallet contract before the execution state is updated, allowing unauthorized withdrawals.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can repeatedly call the `executeTransaction` function, draining funds from the MultiSigWallet by crafting a contract with a malicious fallback function that can make recursive calls to `executeTransaction`. This could result in the loss of all funds held by the wallet.",
