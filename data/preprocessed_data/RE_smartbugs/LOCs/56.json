            "vulnerabilityReason": "The code makes an external call using `call.value()` to transfer Ether to a destination address before updating the transaction state variable `walletTransaction.executed`. This allows an attacker to exploit the contract by making a recursive call to `executeTransaction` during the external call, allowing multiple withdrawals before the transaction is marked as executed.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "The reentrancy vulnerability allows an attacker to repeatedly call back into the contract, performing multiple transactions before the state reflects that the original transaction has been completed. This could lead to unintended behavior such as draining the contract funds, resulting in a potential loss of Ether.",
            "fixedCode": "// Update the executed state before making external calls to prevent reentrancy.\nwalletTransaction.executed = true;\n(bool success, ) = walletTransaction.destination.call.value(walletTransaction.value)(walletTransaction.data);\nif (success) Execution(transactionId);\nelse { ExecutionFailure(transactionId); walletTransaction.executed = false; }"
