            "vulnerabilityReason": "The use of `call.value()` sends Ether to the destination address without enforcing any state changes prior to the call. This allows for potential reentrancy, as an attacker could manipulate the contract's state by making recursive calls before the internal state is updated.",

            "vulnerabilityReason": "The `executeTransaction` function is public and lacks proper access control other than the `onlyAdmin` modifier. While the modifier does limit access, it does not adequately separate state-changing operations from external calls, increasing the risk of reentrancy if an external entity can trigger this operation without proper checks.",
