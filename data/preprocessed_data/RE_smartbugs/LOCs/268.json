This external call is made before updating the executed status of the transaction (`tx.executed`), potentially allowing a reentrant call before the contract state reflects that the transaction has been executed.",

This could allow the attacker to bypass the transaction confirmation steps, enabling unauthorized fund withdrawals and draining the MultiSigWallet's balance.",
