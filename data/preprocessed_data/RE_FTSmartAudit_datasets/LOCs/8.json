            "vulnerabilityReason": "The function 'airDrop' increases the token balance of the caller before checking if the call is supported by the `Bank` contract, and it relies on an external call to check the token while also updating the state. An attacker can exploit this by using a malicious contract to call `airDrop` multiple times before the balance is set, which allows for more tokens to be claimed than intended.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attack contract could retrieve multiple airdrops by calling 'airDrop' during its execution, potentially draining the contract without limits due to poor control over external calls and required conditions.",
