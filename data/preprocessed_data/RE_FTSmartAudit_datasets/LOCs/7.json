            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract is calling `msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)()` before updating the user's credit balance to zero. This can allow a malicious contract to re-enter the `withdrawAll` function before the state (credit balance) is updated, allowing it to withdraw more than its intended allotment.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by deploying a malicious contract that uses a fallback function to call `withdrawAll` again, causing multiple withdrawals and potentially draining the contract's balance.",
