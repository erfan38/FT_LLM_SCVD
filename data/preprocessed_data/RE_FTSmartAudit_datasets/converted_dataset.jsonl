It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9).

Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal.

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7).

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9).

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\n#### How to fix Reentrancy vulnerable code:\n\n# ** 1-Using the Checks-Effects-Interactions

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "you are a cyber security expert that can detect vulnerable line numbers from the contract as well as vulnerableCode, vulnerabilityReason, potentialSecurityRisk, and fixedCode based on the instruction. instruction:\n\n# Reentrancy\nAlso known as or related to race to empty, recursive call vulnerability, call to the unknown.\n\nThe Reentrancy attack, probably the most famous Ethereum vulnerability,surprised everyone when discovered for the first time. It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\n#### How to fix Reentrancy vulnerable code:\n\n# ** 1-Using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**\nThis pattern ensures that contract state updates (effects) occur before any external interaction, preventing reentrant calls from manipulating balances before they are updated.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmsg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");  //  vulnerable: External call before state update\nbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;      //  vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer (vulnerable)\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;      //  fixed: Update balance first (Effects)\n(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");  // fixed: External call after state update (Interactions)\nrequire(success, \"Transfer failed\");  // fixed:  Ensure successful transfer\n\n# **2- Using the Withdrawal Pattern (Pull Payments)**\nInstead of sending Ether directly within a function, store the funds in a mapping and allow users to withdraw later, preventing direct reentrancy.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif (!msg.sender.send(_amount)) {   // Vulnerable: Sends Ether directly to msg.sender\n    revert(\"Transfer failed\");\n}\nbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\n#### How to fix Reentrancy vulnerable code:\n\n# ** 1-Using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**\nThis pattern ensures that contract state updates (effects) occur before any external interaction, preventing reentrant calls from manipulating balances before they are updated.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmsg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");

  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\nmapping(address => uint256) public pendingWithdrawals;\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction withdraw() public {\n    uint256 amount = pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender];

As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\n#### How to fix Reentrancy vulnerable code:\n\n# ** 1-Using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**\nThis pattern ensures that contract state updates (effects) occur before any external interaction, preventing reentrant calls from manipulating balances before they are updated.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmsg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\n#### How to fix Reentrancy vulnerable code:\n\n# ** 1-Using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**\nThis pattern ensures that contract state updates (effects) occur before any external interaction, preventing reentrant calls from manipulating balances before they are updated.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmsg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions.

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\n#### How to fix Reentrancy vulnerable code:\n\n# ** 1-Using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**\nThis pattern ensures that contract state updates (effects) occur before any external interaction, preventing reentrant calls from manipulating balances before they are updated.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmsg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");

 // fixed:  Ensure successful transfer\n\n# **2- Using the Withdrawal Pattern (Pull Payments)**\nInstead of sending Ether directly within a function, store the funds in a mapping and allow users to withdraw later, preventing direct reentrancy.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif (!msg.sender.send(_amount)) {   // Vulnerable: Sends Ether directly to msg.sender\n    revert(\"Transfer failed\");\n}\nbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;   // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\nmapping(address => uint256) public pendingWithdrawals;\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction withdraw() public {\n    uint256 amount = pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender];

Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9).

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions.

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions.

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7).

Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9).

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\n#### How to fix Reentrancy vulnerable code:\n\n# ** 1-Using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**\nThis pattern ensures that contract state updates (effects) occur before any external interaction, preventing reentrant calls from manipulating balances before they are updated.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmsg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");

 // fixed:  Ensure successful transfer\n\n# **2- Using the Withdrawal Pattern (Pull Payments)**\nInstead of sending Ether directly within a function, store the funds in a mapping and allow users to withdraw later, preventing direct reentrancy.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif (!msg.sender.send(_amount)) {   // Vulnerable: Sends Ether directly to msg.sender\n    revert(\"Transfer failed\");\n}\nbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;   // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\nmapping(address => uint256) public pendingWithdrawals;\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction withdraw() public {\n    uint256 amount = pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender];

 // Fixed: External call after state update (Interactions)\n    require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n}\n\nfunction deposit() public payable {\n    pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n}\n\n# **3- Use a Reentrancy Guard**\nA reentrancy guard prevents multiple reentrant calls by locking the function during execution.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n\nfunction withdraw(uint256 _amount) external {\n    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");  // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n    require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n\n    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol\";\n\ncontract SecureContract is ReentrancyGuard {\n    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n\n    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external nonReentrant {\n        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9).

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 1.\n\n\n#### How to fix Reentrancy vulnerable code:\n\n# ** 1-Using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**\nThis pattern ensures that contract state updates (effects) occur before any external interaction, preventing reentrant calls from manipulating balances before they are updated.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmsg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");

 // fixed:  Ensure successful transfer\n\n# **2- Using the Withdrawal Pattern (Pull Payments)**\nInstead of sending Ether directly within a function, store the funds in a mapping and allow users to withdraw later, preventing direct reentrancy.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\n\nif (!msg.sender.send(_amount)) {   // Vulnerable: Sends Ether directly to msg.sender\n    revert(\"Transfer failed\");\n}\nbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;   // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\nmapping(address => uint256) public pendingWithdrawals;\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nfunction withdraw() public {\n    uint256 amount = pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender];

 // Fixed: External call after state update (Interactions)\n    require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n}\n\nfunction deposit() public payable {\n    pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n}\n\n# **3- Use a Reentrancy Guard**\nA reentrancy guard prevents multiple reentrant calls by locking the function during execution.\n\n### **Vulnerable Code:**\nmapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n\nfunction withdraw(uint256 _amount) external {\n    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");  // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n    require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n\n    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n\n### **fixed Code:**\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol\";\n\ncontract SecureContract is ReentrancyGuard {\n    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n\n    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external nonReentrant {\n        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;

It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.\n\n\n## Attack Scenario\n1- A smart contract tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public withdraw() function.\n2- A malicious smart contract uses the withdraw() function to retrieve its entire balance.\n3- The victim contract executes the call.value(amount)() low level function to send the ether to the malicious contract before updating the balance of the malicious contract.\n4- The malicious contract has a payable fallback() function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the victim contract's withdraw() function.\n5- This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the malicious contract still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the malicious contract successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions.

When the low level call() function sends ether to the msg.sender address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint _amount) {\n\trequire(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n\tmsg.sender.call.value(_amount)(); // Vulnerable: External call before state update\n\tbalances[msg.sender] -= _amount;  // Vulnerable: Balance updated after transfer\n}\n````\n\nReentrancy vulnerability is considered as an invocation to _call.value_ that can call back to itself through a chain of calls.\n\n\n### How to label the reentrancy vulnerability?\nWe refer to several expert patterns to label the reentrancy vulnerability. \n1) **callValueInvocation** that checks whether there exists an invocation to call.value in the function.\n2) **balanceDeduction** checks whether the user balance is deducted after money transfer using _call.value_, which considers the fact that the money stealing \ncan be avoided if user balance is deducted each time before money transfer.\n3) **zeroParameter** checks whether the parameter of the _call.value_ function itself is zero.\n4) **ModifierConstrain** checks whether the function is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier.\nWe consider a function as suspicious to have a reentrancy vulnerability if it fulfills the combined pattern: **callValueInvocation \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 balanceDeduction \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 zeroParameter \u00e2\u02c6\u00a7 (!ModifierConstrain)**.\n\n\n\n#### callValueInvocation\n\nNote that we treat those functions with an invocation to *call.value* as the target functions. As such, we first utilize the pattern **callValueInvocation** to filter those functions without an invocation to _call.value_.\n\n\n#### zeroParameter\n\nCase 1: When the _call.value_ exists in the function and the parameter of the *call.value* is zero, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n     \n     ```\n        1.contract HiroyukiCoinDark {\n        2.    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n        3.    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) {\n        4.        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        5.        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value;\n        6.        balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to] + _value;\n        7.        assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)());\n        8.        return true;\n        9.    }\n        10.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the parameter of _call.value_ is zero (line 7). Thus, we label that the function _transfer_ dose not exist the reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### balanceDeduction\n\nCase 1: When the parameter of _call.value_ is not zero and the user balance is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n   \n    ```\n        1.contract NIZIGEN {\n        2.    mapping (address => uint) balances;  \n        3.    function transfer(uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool) { \n        4.      if(true) {\n        5.          if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) revert();\n        6.          balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;\n        7.          assert(msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data));\n        8.          return true;\n        9.      }\n        10.      else {\n        11.          return false;\n        12.      }\n        13.    }\n        14.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the user balance _balances[msg.sender]_(line 6) is deducted before money transfer using _call.value_ (line 7). Thus, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\n#### modifierDeclaration\n\nCase 1: When a function has the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have no reentrancy vulnerability.\n    \n    ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  address owner;\n        5.  modifier onlyOwner() {\n        6.    require(msg.sender == owner);\n        7.    _;\n        8.  }   \n        9.  function forwardFunds() internal onlyOwner {\n        10.     wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        11.     balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        12.  }\n        13.}\n    ```\n    \nAs can be seen, the function _forwardFunds_ is constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9). Thus, we label the function _forwardFunds_ to have no reentrancy vulnerability, i.e., label = 0.\n\n\nCase 2: When a function has not the _onlyOwner_ modifier constraint, we label the corresponding function to have the reentrancy vulnerability.\n      \n      ```\n        1.contract CrowdsaleWPTByRounds {\n        2.  mapping (address => uint) balances;\n        3.  address wallet;\n        4.  function forwardFunds() internal {\n        5.    wallet.call.value(msg.value).gas(10000000)();\n        6.    balances[wallet] -= msg.value;\n        7.  }\n        8.}\n    ```\n    \nIt can be observed, the function _forwardFunds_ is not constrained by the _onlyOwner_ modifier(line 9).
