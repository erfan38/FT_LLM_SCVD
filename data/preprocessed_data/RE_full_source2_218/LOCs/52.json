            "vulnerabilityReason": "The contract uses 'call.value(_am)()' to send Ether to msg.sender. This allows the recipient to execute arbitrary code during the call, which can lead to reentrancy if the recipient is a contract. A malicious contract can re-enter the Collect function before the state (Accounts[msg.sender]) is updated, allowing it to withdraw funds multiple times.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "A malicious actor can create a contract that calls back into the Collect function repeatedly, draining the funds from the contract before the account balance is updated, potentially leading to a complete loss of the contract's funds.",
