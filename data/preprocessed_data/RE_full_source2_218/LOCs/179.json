            "vulnerabilityReason": "The line `msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()` allows the receiving contract (if `msg.sender` is a contract) to execute code before the state variables are updated. This means the recipient could re-enter the `withdraw` function before the balance is deducted, enabling multiple withdrawals of funds that exceed the user's balance.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "An attacker could create a malicious contract that exploits this vulnerability, allowing them to drain the contract's balance by calling `withdraw` multiple times before the state is updated.",
