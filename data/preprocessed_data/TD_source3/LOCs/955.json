            "vulnerabilityReason": "The mint function checks if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to the last mint time plus the mint interval. Since miners can influence the block timestamp, they can manipulate it to mint tokens more frequently than intended.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "Allowing miners to manipulate the timestamp can lead to excessive minting of tokens, resulting in inflation and devaluation of the tokens. This undermines the intended minting schedule and can lead to fairness issues in the token distribution.",
