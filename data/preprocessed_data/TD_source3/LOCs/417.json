            "vulnerabilityReason": "This line relies on block.timestamp to determine if the tokens can be released. Miners can manipulate block timestamps within a small range, which can affect the logic of the release and potentially allow for early or delayed token distributions.",
            "potentialSecurityRisk": "If a miner manipulates the block timestamp, they might trigger the release condition prematurely, allowing unauthorized access to tokens. This compromises the intended lock periods (e.g., INVESTOR_LOCK_DURATION, TEAM_LOCK_DURATION) and endangers the trust in the token distribution model.",
            "fixedCode": "require(block.timestamp >= tokenLock.releaseTime + TIME_TOLERANCE); // where TIME_TOLERANCE is a defined constant, e.g., 15 minutes to prevent minor manipulations."
